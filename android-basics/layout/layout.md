### **Frame Layout**

- **FrameLayout** = a simple ViewGroup subclass in Android that hold a single child view or a stack of overlapping child views. It positions each child in the top-left corner by default and allows them to overlap on top of each other

⇒ which makes it useful for situations where you need to layer views on top of one another.

### **Linear Layout**

- **LinearLayout** is a view group that aligns all children in a single directioni, vertically or horizontally. You can specify the layout direction with the **`android:orientation`** attribute.

### **Relative Layout**

- A **RelativeLayout** in Android is a type of ViewGroup that allows you to position child views relative to each other or relative to the parent layout. It’s a flexible layout where you can arrange the child views in relation to one another based on certain rules, making it suitable for creating complex UI designs.
