Android is built on the Linux kernel, which manages processes, threads, memory, and hardware.
	Each installed Android application is assigned a unique Linux user ID (UID).
	This UID isolates its files, memory, and resources, creating a sandbox.
	each app runs in its own Linux process.

	Inside that process, the Android runtime (Dalvik/ART) executes the app’s bytecode.

	Linux kernel’s process scheduler manages CPU time across apps.

	Creating extra processes = higher memory usage and slower IPC (inter-process communication).
	=> Android recommends using multiple threads within a single process
=> each application is essentially a Linux user running in its own sandboxed process, with its own VM runtime

Android’s Zygote -> Enables Fast and Efficient App Launching
	In biology, a zygote is the first cell formed when a sperm and an egg unite. It carries a complete DNA blueprint, 
	like two config files merged into one unique setup, containing everything needed to bootstrap a full human system.
	-> From there, the cell divides and replicates, running a biological “build process”

	it’s a pre-initialised process that forks to create every app, saving time and resources. 
	One origin, many clones, just like life itself.

	Dalvik VM -> prioritises mobile performance factors, including lower battery consumption and efficient execution.

	They then faced a new problem: each time an app launched, it had to load the shared classes and framework code, graphic 
	drivers, libraries, shared text resources, and other resources from scratch, consuming memory, CPU, and battery.

	Their idea was to create a single process that preloads all the necessary components in advance. Then, when a system app 
	needs to open or a user launches an app, the system simply forks this pre-initialized process. 

	The newly created app process inherits all the preloaded resources, resulting in faster startup times, reduced memory and 
	CPU usage, and ultimately, lower battery consumption.

	That’s also why, when your app Crashes/ANRs, you see ZygoteInit.main sitting at the bottom of the stack trace, 
	simply because it’s the one that gave birth to your app process.
