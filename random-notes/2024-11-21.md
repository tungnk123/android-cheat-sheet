1. **android handle memory management**
    - garbage collection (GC)
    - memory allocation: Memory is allocated for different components (Activities, Services,
    Fragments) based on their lifecycle state (active, paused, stopped)
    - low memory management: Android monitors memory usage and may kill background processes if memory is low
        - Apps can respond to low memory situations using callbacks like onTrimMemory()
2. **Avoiding Memory Leaks**
    - Use Weak References
    - Avoid Long-Lived Context References
    - Use lifecycle-aware components (ViewModel, LiveData)
    - Release resources in lifecycle methods like onPause(), onStop(), or onDestroy()
    - Utilize tools like Android Profiler or LeakCanary
3. **Dependency injection type**
    - Constructor Injection
    - Setter Injection (property injection)
    - Interface Injection: The class implements an interface to receive its dependencies
4. **Dependency injection benefits**
    - Improved Testability
    - Loose Coupling
    - Code Reusability
    - Easier Maintenance
    - Better Separation of Concerns
5. selectedItems.map { it.size }
.sum()
=> selectedItems.sumOf { it.size }

6. CompositionLocal
    - CompositionLocal is a tool for passing data down through the Composition implicitly
    create tree-scoped named objects that can be used as an implicit way to have data flow through the UI tree
    - The Composition is the record of the call graph of composable functions.
    The UI tree or UI hierarchy is the tree of LayoutNode constructed, updated, and maintained by the composition process
    => share data between Composables within the Composition tree without passing it explicitly through function parameters.
7. MaterialTheme is an object that provides three CompositionLocal instances: colorScheme, typography and shapes
8. aspectRatio(2f), // Set the aspect ratio to 2:1 (width:height)
9. modifier.weight()
