1. Freezes for over 5 seconds -> ANR

2. Inspecting performance in android
	Inspect = What's happening in you app aligns with what you expect
	Make sure to inspect performance on a physical device and on the released version of your app
	Built your app with debugable = true -> debugable builds
		-> provide many useful features for development like: live update, applying changes without reinstalling the app,
		debugger, but it adds performance overhead to your app
	=> make performance unstable with debugable = true
	How to inspect?
		1. Passive
			-> see drops frames, use Logcat, see visual jank
			Tag: Choreographer, OpenGLRenderer
			ActivityTaskManager -> Message: Displayed -> Filter TTID
				Message: Fully Drawed -> See TTFD
		2. Manual
			Debug the problem
			Use profilers
			Should run the profiler on a non-debuggable of your app
			Add profileable tag to AndroidManifest
		3. Automated

3. What happens if you pass Job() + Job() + Job() to a CoroutineScope?
	In CoroutineContext, each element is identified by a unique key. Job and SupervisorJob share the same key: Job.Key
	=> any element with a duplicate key replaces the previous one.
	=> You're not stacking three jobs â€” you're replacing one with the next. Only the last Job() remains in the scope's context. 
	The first two are silently discarded.

	=> When combining elements of the same type in a CoroutineContext, only the last one is kept. CoroutineContext behaves like a 
	map, not a list.

4. What are the behavioral differences between withContext(Dispatchers.IO) and launch(Dispatchers.IO)?
	-> withContext is a suspending function. It waits for the block to complete before moving on.
	-> launch starts a new coroutine and returns immediately. The rest of the code continues without waiting.

	=> withContext waits for the block to complete. launch runs code in parallel and doesn't wait. Use withContext when the result 
		or timing of the code matters.
