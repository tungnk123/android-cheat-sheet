1. tab when rename file
2. f2 -> rename
3. **getOrElse()**
4. **Optimize Collection Operations with asSequence()**
    - Usecase = deal with a large number of chained operations
    - By default, Kotlin collections like List and Set apply each transformation eagerly,
    creating intermediate collections for each step
    => performance overhead
    => use asSequence() => transformations are processed lazily
    => minimizes the creation of intermediate collections and can significantly improve performance for complex pipelines
    - Tip: Avoid asSequence() if only a few operations are performed or if performance is not a concern
5. **Anroid NDK**
Android Native Development Kit = a set of tools that enables you to implement parts of your
Android app in native code languages like C and C++
=> use for execute CPU-intensive tasks; reuse C/C++ code across different platforms;
