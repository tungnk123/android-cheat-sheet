1. Event Tracking + Custom definition in Firebase
2. Kotlin tips for clean codebase
    - use data class
    - use extension functions
    - use apply
    - use coroutine
3. StateFlow update value with .value vs update
    - .value: Read the current value or set a new value directly
    Exp: albumsFlow.value = newAlbumList
    - update: Incrementally or atomically modify state based on its current value
    Exp: albumsFlow.update { it + newAlbum }
    => Use value for simple reads or direct assignments when atomicity isn't a concern.
    => Use update for thread-safe, dependent, or incremental updates to the state.
4. Fast forward in git
    - Moves the target branch pointer to the latest commit of the source branch
    - Requirements: The target branch must not have any new commits since the source branch diverged.
