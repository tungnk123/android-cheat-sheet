Service crash:
	Why?
	call startForegroundService() in MainActivity and not call startForegound() within 5s
	=> startForeground must be called within 5s after startForegroundSerivce()
	=> call startForeground in onStartCommand()

A cold start happens when:
 	Your app process is not running at all, and
 	The system has to fully launch your app from scratch (load classes, initialize services, etc.)
	This is the slowest type of start — compared to:
 		Warm start: your app is in memory but paused
 		Hot start: your app was just backgrounded, and resumes instantly

Normal permissions
 	Auto-granted at install.
 	Low-risk (e.g. INTERNET, VIBRATE).
 	No runtime request needed.
Dangerous (Runtime) permissions ⚠️
 	Protect sensitive data (location, mic, camera, contacts, etc.)
 	Since Android 6.0 (API 23) → must ask at runtime (requestPermissions()).
 	Examples: RECORD_AUDIO, CAMERA, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, READ_CONTACTS.
Special permissions 🚨
 	Higher-level, not requested via requestPermissions() but via system Settings / dedicated APIs.
 	Examples: SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW, WRITE_SETTINGS, MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM. 
 	Some new ones (Android 13+): POST_NOTIFICATIONS.
=> Normar: auto-granted
=> Runtime: must request at runtime
=> special: need system settings
