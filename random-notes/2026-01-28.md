1. **Problem: Activity Recreates Multiple Times**

**Root Cause:** Orientation change when switching between portrait/landscape activities + locale context wrapping

**Flow:**

```
MainActivity (portrait) → DashboardActivity (landscape) → back to MainActivity
→ Orientation changes → MainActivity recreates → Multiple dialogs/permission requests
```

**Why It Happens**

1. **Orientation Change:** portrait ↔ landscape triggers configuration change
    

2. **Locale Wrapping:** `attachBaseContext()` + `createConfigurationContext()` adds locale to config
    

3. **No configChanges:** MainActivity doesn't handle config changes → Android recreates it
    

**Why It Didn't Happen Before**

**Before locale feature:**

- Only orientation change
    

- Android reused MainActivity instance
    

**After locale feature:**

- Orientation + locale context wrap
    

- Multiple configuration changes → forced recreate
    

**Solution: Add configChanges**

xml

```
<activity
    android:name=".ui.main.MainActivity"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait"
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|layoutDirection|screenLayout|keyboardHidden" />
```

**DO NOT add** `**locale**` - it breaks language switching

**Problem:** `attachBaseContext()` locale wrapping + orientation change = multiple recreates

**Solution:** `configChanges` without `locale` + AppCompatDelegate



2. **small apps with the right users outperform large apps with the wrong ones**.

	_Revenue now comes from value, not volume._
	
	**In 2026, niche wins.**
	
	**Step 1: Choose a Painful, Specific Problem**
	
	Profitable apps solve **one clear problem**.
	
	**Step 2: Validate Before You Build**
	
	**Step 3: Pick a Monetization Model Early**
	
	- Subscription
	    
	- One-time purchase
	    
	
	**Step 4: Build a Small, Strong MVP**
	
	**Step 5: Design for Retention, Not Downloads**
	
	**Retention Features That Work in 2026**
	
	- Smart reminders
	    
	- Usage streaks
	    
	- Saved history
	    
	- Progress tracking
	    
	- Cloud sync
	    
	**Step 6: Onboarding Is Everything**
	
	**Step 7: Build Trust Before Asking for Money**
	
	Ask for payment **after users feel benefit**, not before.


3. Tips for achieving instant app launch on Android from 5s to 2s.
	- 3 type of app starts:
		- Cold start:
			- The app is launched for the first time since the device was booted
			- a new app process is created, all the necessary resources are allocated, UI is initialized,run ContentProviders, and Application.onCreate()
		- Warm start:
			- **_A warm_** start occurs when the app process is still existing in the memory, but the app is not in the foreground.
			- the system does not create a new process but instead reinitializes some components
		- Hot Start: 
			- When the app is in the background and still in memory, it is called **Hot Start**.
		- Cold Start - Process (New) | Activity (New) | UI (New) | Speed (Slowest)
		- Warm Start — Process (Exiting) | Activity (New) | UI (New) | Speed (Faster)
		- Hot Start — Process (Exiting) | Activity (Exiting) | UI (Exiting) | Speed (Fastest)
		- To make the Android Cold Start process more efficient, from 5s to 2s.we need to focus on **Cold Start stype.**
		- Actually, What Happens during a Cold Start?
			1. Create an app process.
			2. Initialize the Application class.
			3. Set up ContentProviders.
			4. Inflate the first Activity and its layout.
		- ## **Key** Techniques — For Cold Start Optimization.
			- 1. **Don’t do heavy Work in the Application Class**
				- Use lazy initialization for non-critical SDKs.
				- We can use WorkManager or _CoroutineScope (Dispacthers.Deault)_ for large background tasks
				- Initialize only required components early
			- **2. Optimize ContentProviders (Check SDKs and third-party libraries)**
				- Merge or disable unnecessary ones **ContentProviders** (especially from SDKs and third-party libraries).
			- **3. Minimize Layout Inflation on First Screen**
				- **ConstraintLayout** instead of nested LinearLayouts.
				- **MotionLayout** or skeleton UI placeholders.
			- **4. Enable Splash Screen**
				- Use the official SplashScreen API; it starts rendering before the app’s process finishes initializing.
			- **5. Reduce Dex and Class Loading Time**
				- Use **R8 / ProGuard** to shrink and optimize classes.
				- Use **App Startup library** for fine-grained control over initialization order.
				- Avoid unused dependencies and keep your _build.gradle_ clean.
			- **6. androidx.startup:startup-runtime**
				- Initializer<T/> Use this one for (Logging, Analytics, Firebase, WorkManager, Theme Manager)
				- No Manual Writing in Application Class
				- Great For Multimodule Apps
				- Faster Startup
