1. Anti-Pattern: Stop Leaking Kotlin Flow Collectors in Your Android ViewModel
Using Flow.collect() directly in a ViewModel can create multiple collectors that are not properly released
=> leading to memory leaks.

```
If called multiple times (e.g., by a "pull to refresh" action), each call adds a new collector that remains active
until the ViewModel is destroyed, resulting in leaked collectors.

Solution 1: Use the stateIn() operator to convert a Flow from the data source into a StateFlow.
=> prevents unnecessary data collection by only collecting when the UI is observing

Solution 2: Use MutableSharedFlow with flatMapLatest() for cases requiring data refresh (like a refresh button)
=> This approach ensures only the most recent collection is active.

```

=>  use safer Flow operators like stateIn and flatMapLatest to manage data collection effectively.

1. Kotlin supports calculations directly within property declarations. This means that values can be computed dynamically when
an object is created, eliminating the need for additional initialization logic inside constructors or functions.
-> object creation while ensuring efficient calculations without needing explicit init blocks or setter methods.
EXP: data class A (val b: Int, val c = b * 2)

5. Mapbox API vs GoogleMap vs OpenStreetMap API (free)
6. AppWidgetProvider implement BroadcastReceiver -> custom widget
