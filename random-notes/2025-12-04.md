1. How to hide compass, scale line and logo in mapbox
	- mapbox.scalebar.enabled = false
	- mapbox.compass.enabled = false
	- mapbox.logo.enabled = false
	- mapbox.attribution.enabled = false
2. DI 
	- binds: inteface
	- provide: object
3. I’ve Read 20+ Coding Books — Here Are My Top 5 Recommendations (After 21 Years of Writing Code)
	- Clean Code — Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)
	- The Pragmatic Programmer — Andrew Hunt & David Thomas
	- Refactoring (2nd Edition) — Martin Fowler
	- Designing Data-Intensive Applications — Martin Kleppmann
	- A Philosophy of Software Design — John Ousterhout
4. Bosch Android Developer Interview Experience
	- Why Multi-modular?
		- Faster build times
		- Reusable components (Bosch has multiple apps internally)
		- Easier onboarding
	- Offline-first Strategy
		- Use **Room** + **Flow** for reactive local data
		- Use **WorkManager** for retry logic
		- Cache invalidation rules based on domain logic
	- “How do you handle disagreements with architects?”
		- “By focusing on data. I prove architectural decisions using metrics — startup time, memory usage, recomposition count, build time impact.”
	- “How do you mentor junior developers?”
		- “By reviewing code with a teaching intention, not judgement. And making them own end-to-end features so they gain confidence.”
5. How do you handle exceptions in coroutines? What's the difference between `try/catch`, `CoroutineExceptionHandler`, and supervisorScope?
	- **try/catch:** Best for handling predictable errors inside a coroutine (network failure, parse error).
	- **CoroutineExceptionHandler:** A context-level handler for uncaught exceptions in coroutines launched with `launch`. It does not catch exceptions thrown by `async` unless `await` is called.
	- **supervisorScope / SupervisorJob:** Children operate independently — if one fails, others continue. Useful when multiple parallel tasks shouldn't cancel each other.
	- **Propagation basics:** In a normal `coroutineScope`, one child failure cancels the whole scope. In `supervisorScope`, it doesn't.
	- **Best practice:** Prefer local `try/catch` for predictable errors; use `supervisorScope` when running independent tasks; use `CoroutineExceptionHandler` for logging/unexpected crashes.
