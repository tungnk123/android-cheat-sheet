1. Myth 4: Allocating objects is expensive, I should use pools
2. Strangeness 1: Multidex: Does it affect my app performance?
cold startup time -> no impact
apk size -> slight increase
memory -> slight increase
=> However, you can minimize this increase by reducing the dependencies between the dex files
=> R8 and D8 tools
3. Strangeness 2: Dead code
We found that a significant portion of the app code does not get profiled by the ART interpreter-JIT system
error-handling code
code for backward compatibility
code for infrequently used features
The quick, easy, and free way to remove unnecessary code is to minify with R8
use Android App Bundle
