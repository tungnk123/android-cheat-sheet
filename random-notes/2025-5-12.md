it.setHasStableIds(true)
	tells the RecyclerView.Adapter to use stable item IDs.
	It helps RecyclerView optimize performance by identifying items by a unique ID instead of just their position.	
	It improves animations and prevents unnecessary reloads when the list changes.
	Especially useful when using DiffUtil or ListAdapter.
=> you must override getItemId(position: Int) in your adapter to return a unique and stable ID for each item.
=> You must override getItemId() if you enable stable IDs, or else the optimization won't work properly — and you might actually make 
things worse.
=> RecyclerView will assume that the position is the ID, which defeats the purpose of stable IDs.Incorrect diffing when using 
		
ListAdapter or DiffUtil.

setItemViewCacheSize(10)
	Increases the number of ViewHolders that are kept in memory instead of being recycled.
	Helps make scrolling smoother, especially for complex item layouts or large lists.
	The default cache size is 2 — setting it to 10 means up to 10 off-screen views are reused without rebinding.
=> you have a long list or heavy item views

5 Practical Code Examples
	Example 1: Loading Data in a Fragment
		Junior:
		viewModel.userData.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) {
    			textView.text = it.name
		}

		Middle:
		viewModel.userData.observe(viewLifecycleOwner) { user ->
    			user?.let {
        			textView.text = it.name
    			}
		}

		Senior:
		lifecycleScope.launchWhenStarted {
    			viewModel.userData
        		.filterNotNull()
        		.collect { user ->
            			textView.text = user.name
        		}
		}

	Example 2: Making a Network Request with Retrofit
		val flow = flow { emit(api.getUser()) }
    		.flowOn(Dispatchers.IO)
    		.catch { handleError(it) }
    		.onEach { updateUI(it) }
		lifecycleScope.launchWhenStarted { flow.collect() }

	Example 3: RecyclerView Adapter Setup
		val adapter = SpecialAdapter().also {
    			submitList(userList)
    			setHasStableIds(true)
		}
		recyclerView.run {
    			this.adapter = adapter
    			setItemViewCacheSize(10)
		}

	Example 4: Navigation Between Fragments
		safeNavigate {
    			val action = HomeFragmentDirections.actionHomeToDetail(itemId)
    			findNavController().navigate(action)
		}
	Example 5: State Management in ViewModel
		Middle: 
		private val _isLoading = MutableLiveData<Boolean>()
		val isLoading: LiveData<Boolean> get() = _isLoading
			
		Senior:
		private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(UiState())
		val uiState: StateFlow<UiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()
