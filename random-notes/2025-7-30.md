Top 10 Compose Mistakes in Large-Scale Apps
	1. Ignoring Modularization
		Splitting your application into distinct modules 
		=> simplifies dependency management, reduces build times, and enhances maintainability.
	
	2. Mismanaging State Hoisting
		ensures efficient recompositions and manageable state flow.

	3. Overusing remember
		Using remember unnecessarily complicates code and wastes resources.
		=> Use remember sparingly for expensive calculations or state preservation.

	4. Improper Integration with Legacy Views
		cause memory leaks and lifecycle problems.
		Using AndroidView ensures that the lifecycle of the legacy view is properly tied to the composable's lifecycle

	5. Ignoring Compose Compiler Reports
		Neglecting to analyze compiler reports means missing optimization opportunities.
		Without analysis, performance bottlenecks remain hidden.

	6. Inefficient List Handling
		Failing to provide keys in lists results in poor scrolling performance.

	7. Underestimating Theming and Design Systems
		Ignoring a centralized design system leads to inconsistent UI and increased maintenance overhead.		
		
	8. Overcomplicating Navigation
		Complex navigation graphs lead to unmaintainable and error-prone code.
		Type-safe navigation enhances readability and maintainability.
	9. Neglecting Accessibility

	10. Not Writing UI Tests
		Skipping UI tests leads to regressions and unstable UI behaviors.
		Ignoring accessibility considerations excludes many users who rely on assistive technologies.
