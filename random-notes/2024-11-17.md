1. viewModelScope.launch {
val currentChannel = channel.value ?: return@launch
2. OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder vs PeriodicWorkRequestBuilder
3. zipToNext()

```jsx
onPreviousChannelClick = {
	viewModel.getPreviousChannel()
}
=> create a lambda which call a function
```

`onPreviousClick = viewModel::onPreviousClick`

=> function reference to the function

Lambda ({}) vs 	Method Reference (::)
Explicitly creates a lambda vs Passes a reference to a method
You can add more logic inside the lambda vs Only refers to the method directly
Slightly more overhead for creating a lambda vs More direct and efficient.

=> use a lambda if you need to add more logic before or after calling the function
=> use a method reference if the method reference suffices for your use case and more cleaner, concise code

4. map vs flatmap
    - One-to-one transformation.	One-to-many transformation (flattened).
    - Preserves the structure (single level) vs 	Flattens nested structures.
    - Simple value transformations.	Handling nested or asynchronous streams.
    - Not applicable. 	vs Handles multiple streams concurrently (flatMapMerge)
    or sequentially (flatMapConcat).

=> **map**: You convert each box in a row of boxes into another box (1-to-1).
=> **flatMap**: Each box might contain another row of boxes, and you flatten all the contents into a
single row of boxes (1-to-many).
