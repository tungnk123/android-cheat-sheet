1. How would you implement a custom lifecycle observer to handle specific events in your app?
    -  Create a class implementing LifecycleObserver.
    -  Implement methods for desired lifecycle events (e.g., @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME)).
    -  In your Activity/Fragment, get a reference to the LifecycleOwner (usually this).
    -  Use getLifecycle().addObserver() to register your observer with the LifecycleOwner.
    -  Perform actions in observer methods for specific lifecycle stages.
2. Describe best practices for handling background tasks and network requests during different
Activity/Fragment lifecycle states.
    - onCreate(): Lightweight initialization tasks.
    - onStart(): Good place to start background tasks or network requests (Activity/Fragment is fully visible).
    - onResume(): For data crucial for immediate display (consider user experience and potential delays).
    - onPause(): Pause or cancel long-running tasks or network requests that aren't essential while paused.
    - onStop(): Release resources associated with background tasks, network requests, or database connections to avoid leaks.
    - onDestroy(): Final cleanup tasks (closing cursors, unregistering receivers).
3. LazyPagingItem -> itemSnapShotList sometime get null
4. Ctrl + Alt + Z -> rollback change
5. we cannot have a constructor method in a singleton class.
â‡’ Use init method
