1. cachedIn() just in Flow<PagingData<>>
2. 7 Pro-tips for Room
Pre-populate the database: Use RoomDatabase#Callback! Call the addCallback method when building your RoomDatabase
and override either onCreate or onOpen
Use DAO’s inheritance capability
Execute queries in transactions with minimal boilerplate code
-> Annotating a method with @Transaction makes sure that all database operations you’re executing in that method
will be run inside one transaction
Read only what you need
Enforce constraints between entities with foreign keys
Simplify one-to-many queries via @Relation
Avoid false positive notifications for observable queries
3. Bug: copy vs shallow copy vs deep copy
satItems.collect { items ->
localSatItems.value = items
}
=> satItems and localSatItems reference to the same object
=> localSatItems.value = items.map { it.copy() }
4. Handle update favorite, isTracked with large list -> use @Transaction and handle in Dao
5. collect vs collectLatest: bothare used to collect values emmitted by a flow
collect:
process every emitted value
does not cancel the previous collection when a new value arrives
Processes each value sequentially in the order they are emitted.
Use when every value must be processed completely, even if new values arrive in the meantime.	
collectLatest:
Cancels Previous Collection When a New Value Arrives
If a new value arrives while processing the previous one, the previous processing is canceled.
Only the latest value is processed, skipping any unfinished previous values.
Use when only the latest value matters, and old values can be discarded.
=> collectLatest(): improve performance by skipping unnecessary work and always processing the most recent value
=> improve UI responsives by preventing lag from outdated operations; reduce wasted computation
Collect usecase: chat messages, notification, saving to database
6. there is no flatMap function for Flow, but instead there are flatMapConcat, flatMapMerge and flatMapLatest
