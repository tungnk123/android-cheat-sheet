4. 10 Jetpack Compose: Best Practices
Use Stateless Composables:
Separate UI state from your composables to make them reusable and testable
Pass the state and event handlers as parameters
Break Down Complex UI into Small Composables
Leverage Lazy Components for Large Data Sets: LazyColumn, LazyRow, LazyGrid
Optimize Recomposition: Avoid unnecessary recompositions by marking stable data types or using remember to
cache values
Use DerivedStateOf for Dependent States: Use derivedStateOf to manage expensive computations based on state changes
Handle State with ViewModel
Use Preview for Faster Iteration
Avoid Deep Nesting
Handle UI Performance with Keys
5. FragmentManager Type
supportFragmentManager: Used in Activity; Manage Fragments inside Activity
=> Adding, replacing, or removing fragments in an Activity
childFragmentManager: Used in Fragment (Nested Fragments); Manage Child fragments inside a Fragment
parentFragmentManager: used in Fragment to access parent (Activity)
=> Communicating with the parent
    
    => If you're inside an Activity → Use supportFragmentManager.
    If you're inside a Fragment and managing child fragments → Use childFragmentManager.
    If you're inside a Fragment and want to communicate with its parent → Use parentFragmentManager = supportFragmentManager
    in Activity
