1. Design an Optimized LRU Cache in Kotlin: A Step-by-Step Guide
	- An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache is a data structure that maintains a fixed-size collection of items, automatically **evicting the least recently accessed** item when capacity is exceeded.
	- **Key Properties:**
		- Fixed capacity
		- Fast access and insertion
		- Automatic eviction of least recently used items
		- Maintains access order
	- **The Solution: HashMap + Doubly Linked List** (with Dummy Head and Dummy Tail)
	- When a key is accessed, we need to:
		1. Check if it exists in the HashMap
		2. If it exists, move the corresponding node to the head (mark as most recently used)
		3. Return the value
	- The Put Operation
		- **Case 1: Key already exists**
			- Update the value
			- Move node to head
		- **Case 2: New key**
			- Check if we're at capacity
			- If at capacity, evict LRU item
			- Create new node and add to head
			- Add to HashMap
	- **LRU is ideal when:**
		- Temporal locality is strong (recently accessed items likely to be accessed again)
		- You need predictable performance
		- Memory usage is a concern
	- **Consider alternatives when:**
		- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Access patterns based on frequency rather than recency
		- **Random eviction**: When access patterns are truly random
		- **TTL-based**: When items have natural expiration times
