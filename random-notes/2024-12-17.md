1. Enum Instances are Singleton Objects
If the resolution value in AppConstants is not initialized properly or is evaluated after the enum
constants are created, you will get errors like NullPointerException or inconsistent values
2. When you attempt to initialize or modify the resolution using an external value (like from AppConstants), the compiler or runtime may fail because Kotlin's enum values are instantiated only once during their creation
3. Blocking Call: Operations like file writes, file reads, or database queries block the thread until
the operation completes.
Coroutine Context: Coroutines use lightweight threads. If you block one of these threads, you risk starving the thread pool, which can cause performance degradation or deadlocks.

4. Save images as bitmap -> increase size -> copy the already compressed file directly to DCIM
5. Save images to DCIM
    - compress as a bitmap and save => increase size, not preserve compression
    - copy directly to DCIM folder: copy the file or stream the data from the original compressed file
    => use InputStream and OutputStream
