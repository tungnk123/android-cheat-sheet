1. Handling Backpressure in Kotlin Flows — buffer, conflate, collectLatest, debounce, sample and throttleFirst
	debounce:
		It takes time in milliseconds as a parameter and waits for a pause before emitting a value.
	=> If there's no activity for that amount of time, it emits the last value
	=> Great for search bars, filters, or any input where you don’t want to spam the backend.

	sample():
		Updating charts
		Polling hardware sensors
		UI that needs a fixed refresh rate
	=> emits the latest value at regular intervals, no matter what.

	throttleFirst(): It emits the first item, then ignores others for a fixed time window.
	=> Great for button click protection — avoid accidental double clicks!
