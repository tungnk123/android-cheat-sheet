5 Kotlin Patterns I Wish I Knew Before Building Real Projects
	1. Sealed Classes + When = The Best State Handling Duo

	2. Extension Functions: Less Boilerplate, More Power

	3. let, apply, also, run, with: The Kotlin Scope Functions

	4. Data Class Copy Pattern: Small Change, No Problem

	5. Result Wrappers: Goodbye Try-Catch Hell
		or Resource
		Why Itâ€™s Powerful:
			Centralizes error handling
			Plays well with sealed classes
			Keeps try-catch out of UI layers
