1. Memory leaks, often leading to OutOfMemory (OOM) exceptions
2. Improving Performance in Jetpack Compose Apps
    - Use `remember` to Avoid Recomputations
    - Leverage remember with Keys for State Preservation: val user = remember(userId) { fetchUser(userId) }
    - Minimize Unnecessary Recompositions: Avoid Lambdas Inside Composables, Use key with Lists
    - Use `Lazy` Layouts for Long Lists
    - Use **`SnapshotFlow`** for State Observations
    - Limit Overdraws: Use fewer nested containers like Box, Row, and Column; **Combine** multiple **modifiers** into a single one
    - **Profiling** for Performance Bottlenecks: pay attention to Recomposition Counts, Memory usage
