1. Creata assets folder in Android Studio: New -> Folder -> Assets Folder
    - res folder
    - font folder
    - java folder
    - raw folder
    - aidl folder
    - raw resource folder
    - xml resource folder
2. runCatching {} vs try/catch
    - runCatching:
        - wrapper over try/catch + return Result;
        - Returns a Result Type;
        - Prevents Uncaught Exceptions (wrap errors)
        in a Result.Failure
        - Works well with coroutine: it prevents cancelation exceptions from being swallowed
        - Avoids Nested Try-Catch Blocks
    - try/catch:
        - Can handle exceptions + manual checks
        => runCatching {} when you want a cleaner, functional approach with error chaining,
        - Does not swallow CancellationException
        - Wraps errors safely via Result
        - Chaining operations: onSuccess, onFailure
        => try-catch when you need to handle both exceptions & logical errors in one place.
