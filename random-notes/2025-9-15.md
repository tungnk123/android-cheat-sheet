Media/Playback, Sharing, Slices -> Jetpack Behaviors components

val/var in constructor:
	No val/var → just a constructor parameter, not stored, only usable in init.
 	val → read-only property, accessible anywhere in the class.
 	var → mutable property, can be read & updated.
 	Add private → hides the property from outside (best practice for dependencies in ViewModels/Services).
👉 In DI (Hilt/Koin), use private val almost always.

Apple Rejected My App. Here is the Reason
	How swapping “Allow” for “Continue” saved my App Store submission.
	On iOS, developers are not allowed to influence the user’s choice when granting permissions.
	
	If your custom pre-permission screen also says “Allow,” you’re essentially nudging the user toward a “yes” before the real 
		choice even appears. Apple sees that as misleading — a dark pattern.

	The fix was simple:
		On iOS → use “Continue.”
		On Android → keep “Allow.”
	
	They want users to make decisions in the official dialog, free from developer influence. 
	That’s why they only accept neutral words like “Next” or “Continue.”
