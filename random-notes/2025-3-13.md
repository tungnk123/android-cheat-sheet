Mapbox
	Globe Projection vs Mercator Projection

The two best ways to secure your API keys in Android projects
	First Approach: Using Properties File, local.properties
	Second Approach: Using CMake with NDK
		Install NDK and CMake
		Install a CMake Highlighter
		Add your NDK location in the local.properties file
		Create a “cpp” Folder in your app directory
		Create a CMakeLists.txt file
		So, now we need to make this “libnative-lib.cpp” file to write some C++ code.
		Create this file in the same cpp folder.
		Now, write your C++ code in it. It is easy if you are familiar with C++, but let me give you a template and 
		explain it
		Add following code in the build.gradle of your module

getOrNull() is available in lists (List<T>) but not in maps (Map<K, V>)
	Since Map already returns null safely when a key is not found, there's no need to use getOrNull()

finish() vs finishAffinity() 
	finish() → Closes the current activity. If it’s the last activity in the stack, the app may exit.
	finishAffinity() → Closes the current activity and all parent activities in the same task, effectively exiting the app.
	=> Use finishAffinity() when you want to exit the app completely, not just close one screen

withContext vs launch vs async
	launch: 
		NO return a result
		Runs in a new coroutine
	=> fire-and-forget; dont need a result
	async:
		Return a result (Deferred<T>)
		Runs in a new coroutine


	=> need a result later; or parallelism
	withContext
		Return a result (Direct result)
		No runs in a new coroutine
	=> need a result immediately
		

PagingSource vs PagingData vs Pager vs PagingDataAdapter

Paging with Search function:
	Use in Dao: pagingWithQuery
		SELECT FROM WHERE name LIKE '%' || :query || '%'
		return PagingSource<Int, <<T>>

loadMore() in RecyclerView	

Immutable vs mutable list
	Immutable list:	
		cannot modify
		faster (no synchronous overhead)
		thread safe
	mutable list: 
		can modify
		slower due to modifications
		Not thread safe (modifications cause issues in concurrency)
=> Mutable List require extra memory reallocation and element shifiting, which slows down performance
	require synchronization in multithreaded environments -> performance overhead
	Not single source of truth
