1. Talent Is a Loop, Not a Gift
	- Instead of searching for talent as some hidden essence inside you, you start _b**uilding_ talent as a functional system.**
	- **positive reinforcement loop + Growth Mindset**
	- **to become really good at something, you need to practice a lot. And to practice a lot, it has to feel frictionless.**
	- **deliberate effort → small wins → confidence → enjoyment.**
	- **Adjust strategy and context.** Try different environments, different mentors, different approaches. Give yourself more time, but with different strategies — the loop might form under different conditions.
2. **Why Reading More Books Wasn’t Making Me Smarter**
	- > "Learning is deeper and more durable when it's effortful. Learning that's easy is like writing in sand, here today and gone tomorrow." ~Make it Stick
	- **Stop fast** reading -> enjoy the journey
	- Reading with **purpose**.
	- Reading widely around a topic exposes us to multiple perspectives, which naturally gives us a more balanced understanding and helps build more connections. -> Web of ideas, knowledge
	- If I'm curious about a topic, I read for that **curiosity**.
	- the insights automatically emerged as I started **reading slowly, with purpose.**

1. Parallel API Calls in Kotlin: async vs Flow.zip vs Flow.combine (Complete Guide)
	- async:
		- async is used to run tasks **in parallel** and give you a **Deferred** result that you can later await().
		- One-time API calls
		- Heavy background work you want to run together
	- Flow.zip:
		- zip waits for **one value from each Flow**, and then combines them **pair by pair**.
		- When all sources must emit **matching items**
	- Flow.combine
		- combine emits a new value **whenever any Flow updates**, using the **latest values** from all flows.
		- Live updates
		- UI that must react anytime any data source changes
		- Multiple continuous streams
2. Delegate pattern:
	- **Problems with inheritance in Android**
		- Tight coupling
		- Hard to test
		- One base class only
		- God classes (BaseActivity, BaseViewModel )
	- **Delegation solves this by:**
		- Avoiding deep inheritance trees
		- Promoting **composition**
		- Making code **replaceable and testable**
	- Delegation avoids **tight coupling**, supports **multiple behaviors**, improves **testability**, and aligns with Compose + Clean Architecture.
