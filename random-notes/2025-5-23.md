Optimizing a Laggy Home Screen in Jetpack Compose: Fixing 13 Common Issues for Performance…
	Problem #1: Multiple State Collections with No Lifecycle Awareness
	-> Solution: Use collectAsStateWithLifecycle() and Unify State

	Problem #2: Unoptimized Image Loading
	-> Constrained image loading with placeholder; Specify exact size to load; Crossfade for smooth loading; Memory and disk caching

	Problem #3 & #4: Nested Scrollables Without Keys and Unnecessary Object Creation
	-> Use Keys and Extract Components; Stable keys for items
	-> Add fling behavior for smooth scrolling: flingBehavior = rememberSnapFlingBehavior(lazyListState = rememberLazyListState())
	
	Problem #5: New Lambda on Every Recomposition
	-> Remember lambda

	Problem #6: Repeated Issues in Different Sections
	-> Create Reusable Optimized Components

	Problem #7: Timer Causing Frequent Recompositions
	-> Isolate Timer Updates
	val formattedTime = remember(remainingTimeMillis) {
        	formatTime(remainingTimeMillis)
    	}
	
	Problem #8: Inefficient Grid Implementation
	-> Use LazyVerticalGrid and Proper Keys

	Problems #9–12: Non-remembered Click Modifier, Unconstrained Images, and More
	-> Fully Optimized Card Components: Remember lambda; Optimized image loading

	Problem #13: ViewModel with Multiple StateFlows
	-> Unified State Management: uiState
