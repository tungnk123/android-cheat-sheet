5 Compose Performance Wins with Just One Line of Code
	1). Avoid Unnecessary Recompositions with remember
		remember caches the result during recompositions. Without it, Compose calls getHeavyPainter() every time — killing 
		performance.

	2). Stable Lists with key in LazyColumn
		Providing a key helps Compose track which items actually changed — avoiding unnecessary recomposition and layout 
		recalculations.

	3). Recomposition Guard with derivedStateOf
		derivedStateOf (isValid) only recalculates when its dependencies (email and password) change, helping Compose skip 
		recompositions that don’t impact your UI.

	4). Optimize Scrollable Lists with LazyColumn Instead of Column
		LazyColumn only composes what's visible on screen. Column renders everything at once — bad news for performance on long lists.

	5). Eliminate Redundant Recomposition with stable Data
		Annotating with @Immutable tells Compose the object is safe to skip if unchanged. This can drastically reduce unnecessary 
		recompositions in UI trees.

Coroutine 
	asynchronous programming
	threading and thead management
Flow:
	reactive programming
	data streams

Thread-per-Request
=> Each incoming request gets its own OS thread, which blocks on I/O and processing. This leads to high memory usage (stack per thread) 
	and costly context switches.

Event Loop
=> A single thread continuously polls for I/O completion events, enqueues callbacks, and executes them one by one. 
	It minimizes context switches but can lead to deeply nested callbacks and manual flow-control.

OS Thread = A native, kernel-managed thread with its own stack and registers. Expensive to create and destroy.

Thread Pool = A reusable set of worker threads that pick up tasks from a queue. Reduces thread-creation overhead and caps concurrent 
	threads for resource control.

Executor = An abstraction (e.g., Java’s ThreadPoolExecutor) for submitting and managing tasks on a thread pool, providing policies for max threads, queues, and thread lifetimes.

Reactive Model = Rather than spawning a thread per event, each event becomes a task dispatched to existing executors or an event loop. 
	Declarative streams (observables/publishers), operators, and schedulers coordinate execution contexts, with built-in backpressure 
	and error handling.

Producer = a Flow<T> definition = flow builder function
Data stream = the emissions that Flow generates
Observer = Collector =  the code inside collect (or other terminal operators like toList(), first(), launchIn(...)) that reacts to each 
value, error, or completion.
