1. setContentView() vs setContent()
setContentView() -> inflate a layout XML file in traditional android
setContent() -> define UI in jetpack compose
2. Intent = a messaging object used to request an action form another app component
3. Layout: grid layout, table layout, coordinator layout, motion layout
4. AAB = Android App Bundle -> generate optimized APKs for different device configuration, reduce download size for users
5. Kotlin > java: consiceness syntax, reduce boiterplate code, null safety, functional programming, coroutine
6. Extension functions = functions that add new functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code
7. null represent the absence of a value; ? make a type nullable (can hold null)
8. inline functions = functions whose bytecode is copied to the call site at compile time
=> reducing overhead
9. by vs = in delegation:
by ->  delegates the implementation of a property to another object => used for delegation pattern
= -> assigns a value to the property
10. type erasure in kotlin = process of removing generic type information at compile time, due to limitations of the JVM
11. Map:
Use mapValues { entry -> entry.value.take(20) } to only take 20 values 
12. Optimize Coil:
use .diskCachePolicy(CachePolicy.ENABLED)
use .memoryCachePolicy(CachePolicy.ENABLED)
