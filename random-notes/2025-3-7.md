1. RunBlocking Deadlock Trap
	blocks the current thread while it waits for your coroutines to complete
	The default dispatcher uses a shared pool of threads to execute coroutines.
	the runBlocking call won’t release the thread back to the dispatcher until all the coroutines are complete, 
	but the coroutines can’t run until the default dispatcher has an available thread. That sure sounds like a 
		deadlock waiting to happen

2. If a request is hanging due to any kind of coroutine deadlock, introducing a withTimeout block probably won’t do 
anything at all

3. A dispatcher that has no available threads can’t resume a coroutine at all, even for a timeout or cancellation

4. Goodbye try-catch, Hello runCatching
	We should not catch exceptions unnecessarily, especially in structured applications, and instead let the framework 
		handle them where possible
	In Kotlin, it is generally preferred to handle recoverable failures explicitly by returning a value, such as using 
		Result<T>, rather than throwing exceptions
