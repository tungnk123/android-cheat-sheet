conflate() in Flow:
	skip intermediate emissions if the collector can't keep up, only delivering the most recent value when it's ready again
	without conflate(): every emitted item is bufferd -> back-pressured and sent to the collector in order
	with conflate():  if the collector is busy (heady UI work or chart drawing) -> the flow will drop any new emissions until the collector
		is free -> then immediately emit the lasted value
=> Usecase: UI rendering, sensor streams, network pings, something run faster than UI-update
=> one continious data stream and want to skip intermediate value if the consumer is slow, but you are not starting new tasks per item

conflate() vs flatMapLattest():
	conflate():
		skip intermediate values if the consumer is slow, but you are not starting new tasks per item
	flatMapLattest():
		for each upstream emission -> launch a new inner flow
		if a new upstream value arrives before the previous inner flow completes -> it cancels the previous one and switches to 
	the new inner flow
	=> when each upstream item drives a new asynchronous operation (an inner flow) and you want to cancel any previous operation as 
	soon as a fresh input arrives

Injecting the Applicaition Context into repository is common and recommended pattern:
	@ApplicaitionContext context = lives as long as your app does and cannot leak UI objects
	Never hold an Activity or Fragment context in a long-lived singletion -> memory leaks nad unwanted lifecycle coupling

StateFlow vs SharedFlow in Service + Repository:
	Service -> StateFlow: Let the service own a StateFlow for its internal state
	Repo -> SharedFlow(replay = 1):
		a hot, multicast stream 	
		replay of the last real event, no dummy initial value
		decoupling: the repo simply relays events, it isn't the source of truth
=> StateFlow: when you own the state and want an always-available .value
=> SharedFlow(replay = 1): when you purely broadcasting real events and want the late subscribers to get the most recent one without	
	inventing an initial value => event broadcaster instead of stateholder

Clean code rule
	Keep Android components dumb
	
	If not:
	-> 	You can’t unit test it
		You can’t reuse the logic
		You need real pushes to test it

	=> The Better Way: Delegate Everything
	Your service shouldn’t contain logic. It should forward work to injected, testable components.

	Same Pattern for BroadcastReceivers
		Bad pattern — logic inside the receiver
		Better pattern — delegate logic

	=> Unit Testing with Robolectric and Fakes is so easy
=> 	Android components should delegate, not do
	Move logic into injectable classes
	Create domain models to decouple from SDKs
	Unit test with fakes, verify UI with UIAutomator

Android 16 x Material 3 Expressive Redesign
	Expressive design makes you feel something.
	It inspires emotion, communicates function, and helps users achieve their goals. Think of it as design with a soul.
	=> emotionally impactful UX

IPC = inter-process communication =describes how different Android components talk to each other
	Intents are messages that components can send and receive.
	Bundles are data containers passed through intents. 
	Binders allow activities and services to get a reference to another service. This lets you not only send messages to services but also call methods on them directly.

BroadcastReceiver = component that lets your app listen for system-wide or app-specific messages
	uses the Binder IPC
	Sending a Broadcast: The app or system uses Context.sendBroadcast() or Context.sendOrderedBroadcast() to send a broadcast intent.
	Queuing in AMS: The ActivityManagerService (AMS) receives the broadcast request and enqueues it for processing.
	Finding Registered Receivers: The system looks up all the receivers registered for the broadcast action. (static: Manifest or dynamic at run time: Context.registerReceiver())
	The intent is sent to the onReceive() method of each matching receiver on the main thread.

How to connect Service <-> UI:
	Use Binder (Bound Service):
		clients calls bindService() -> gets an IBinder -> interacts directly
		In-process method calls, very low overhead
		Type-safety: you get a real service instance; can call its methods and collect flows
		Strictly within your app's process
		Life cycle management: you explicitly bind and unbind -> lifecycle is clear and leak-safe
		More security: private to your app, no extra work
		Setup complexity: more boilerplate code (ServiceConnection, Binder subclass)
	=> Best for continous data streams or direct method calls
	
	Use BroadcastReceiver: 
		Service call sendBroadcast() -> any registered receiver gets an Intent
		Performance: intent serialization/deserialization, higher overhead
		Data carried as primitives or Parcelables in an Intent -> risk of mismatched keys/types
		Scope: system-wide (or local if you use LocalBroadcastManager)
		Lifecycle-management: you must register/unregister receivers carefully -> easy to leak or miss events
		You may need permissions or restrict to local broadcasts
		Setup complexity: very simple: sentIntent + registerReceiver
		
	=> one-off events or system-wide notifications

BoundService vs BackgroundService:
	BoundService:
		A service that a client binds to and interacts with directly
		Lifecycle: lives as long as least one client is bound
		Clients obtain an interface (IBinder) and call methods or observe Flows
		Can be foreground or background service
	=> Usecase: clients needs rich, synchorounous or streaming interaction (media playback controls, sensor streams)
	
	BackgroundService:
		A service that you start with startService or startForegroundService() -> run independently
		Lifecycle: live until you stop it or the system kills it
		No direct interface -> communication via Intents, broadcasts or other IPC
		Recommended foreground service with a persistent notification
	=> Usecase: talks that should run without a UI present (file downloads, uploads, sync)
=> BoundService: your app components need to call into the service or observe live data streams in a type-safe, low-latency way
=> Background/Stared Service: you need work to continue even if no UI is active - especially for long-running or scheduled tasks

BoundService:
	A bound service lets other components (Activities, other Services) bind to it and interact through a client–server interface. 
	It typically runs only as long as clients are connected.

	- Extend Service (or LifecycleService).
	- Override onBind(Intent): return an IBinder that exposes your API.

	- Client calls `bindService(intent, connection, flags)`.
	- Android invokes `onServiceConnected(ComponentName, IBinder)`, supplying your binder.
	- Client keeps the connection until it calls `unbindService(connection)` (or its lifecycle ends).
=> Usecase: realtime data streaming: clients binds once then collects a continious Flow from service with minimal latency and type safety
	media playback, hardware control: camera focus, flashlight, ...
	two-way communication in same process
	lifecycle-scoped work
	exposing functionality to other apps
=> Fire-and-forget background jobs (downloads, uploads, period sync) -> foreground service or WorkManager
=> Occastional notifications of one-off events -> broadcast or livedata backed singletion
