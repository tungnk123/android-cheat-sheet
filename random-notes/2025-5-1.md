	Number 6:
		🔴 Junior: “I need permission to do this.”
		🟢 Senior: “I take ownership and make it happen.”
	=> They owned problems instead of passing them off.
	=> They found solutions instead of just reporting issues.
	=> They took action instead of waiting for instructions.
	
	Number 7:
		🔴 Junior: “Let me start coding right away.”
		🟢 Senior: “Let’s analyze the problem and plan the best approach”.
	=> They asked why before how.
	=> They designed before they built.
	=> They solved problems, not just wrote code.

	Writing code is easy.
	Writing the right code is what matters.
	Think first. Code second.

	=> Remember — Measure twice, cut once.
