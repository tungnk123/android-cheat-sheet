1. Coroutine Dispatcher
default: CPU-bound tasks; provides a limited number of threads equal to the number of CPU cores
=> computation-intensive tasks: complex mathematical calculatiosn, image procesing
=> CPU-bound algorithms: Sorting, searching, graph traversal, or other algorithms that
heavily rely on CPU resources
=> encryption/decryption: Cryptographic operations involving large files or multiple tasks
VD: image/video processing: filter, resize images, videos; large data transformation; physical
simulation, weather forecasting
2. io dispatcher: network requests, file operations, or database interactions
larget thread pool
3. ViewHolder pattern = inflate one, reference views, bind data
A ViewHolder object is a simple class that holds references to the views within a list itemâ€™s
layout (e.g., TextView, ImageView).
As the user scrolls, you bind new data to the existing ViewHolders in the pool, rather than
inflating entire new layouts.
4. configuration change:
- rotation
- language change
- screen size change: foldable devices
- locale change: time, date, number format
- keyboard availability
- lightmode, darkmode
5. ViewModelStoreOwner vs ViewModelStore vs LifecycleOwner
LifecycleOwner vs LiveData
live data only emit data to observers when lifecycleowner is active(RESUMED)
6. enum class:
constructor paramater vs property parameter
=> use property parameter so we can access it value
7. add HttpLoggingInterceptor in Okthttp to log
