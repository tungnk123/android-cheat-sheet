Enum class:
	entries()
	name -> return name of this enum constant
	ordinal -> return the ordinal of this enumeration

ignoreUnknownKeys = true
	Ignore any extra fields in the JSON that are not in your Kotlin data model
	Prevents crashes if server sends new/extra fields
coerceInputValues = true
	If JSON has invalid values (e.g., enum not recognized, number out of range), they are replaced with default values instead of throwing an error
	Makes parsing more tolerant
explicitNulls = false
	JSON null values will be skipped instead of setting the property to null explicitly
	Keeps default values if null is received
isLenient = true
	Accepts non-standard JSON (e.g., comments, unquoted keys, single quotes, etc.)
	Loosens strict JSON rules

=> 	ignoreUnknownKeys → tolerate extra JSON keys
 	coerceInputValues → tolerate bad values
 	explicitNulls → control how nulls are treated
 	isLenient → tolerate non-standard JSON syntax


Google Play Policy: From Jan 22, 2025, apps cannot use READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_MEDIA_VIDEO unless the core purpose is managing 
	photos/videos (gallery, editor, backup, etc.). IPTV players don’t qualify.
 	
	What to do:
		Remove these permissions from AndroidManifest.xml.
		Use Photo Picker API (ActivityResultContracts.PickVisualMedia) on Android 13+ for user-selected media.
		Fallback to Storage Access Framework (OpenDocument / OpenMultipleDocuments) on older Android.
		Update Play Console → Permissions Declaration → mark as no sensitive media permissions.
 	Do NOT use READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED unless your app needs persistent access to previously selected files (most IPTV apps don’t).
 	Result: You comply with Google’s privacy rules, avoid rejection, and still let users pick media when needed.

=> 	If your app wants full control with your own gallery picker, you must use:
 		READ_MEDIA_IMAGES / READ_MEDIA_VIDEO
 		Plus new READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED for partial access / reselection.

External Storage vs SAF
	Refers to shared storage (e.g., /storage/emulated/0/).
	Before Android 10 → apps could freely read/write with permissions:
		<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
		<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

	From Android 10+ (Scoped Storage) → access is restricted:
		Apps can freely use only their own app-specific folder (/Android/data/<package>/files/…).
		For other files → must use SAF or MediaStore.
