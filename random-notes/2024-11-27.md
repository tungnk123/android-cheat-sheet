1. ItemTouchHelper in RecyclerView
2. Kotlin coding patterns
    - Use early returns:  expected positive result is returned at the end of the function and the
    rest of the code terminates the execution (by returning or throwing an exception)
    when conditions are not met
    => fail-fast approach, handle failures first, linear structure
    - Avoid booleans in function arguments
        - using enums instead of booleans
        
        ```jsx
        BEFORE
        
        fun isPrimeUser(isPrime: Boolean) {
        if (isPrime) {
        println("User is PRIME")
        } else {
        println("User is Regular")
        }
        }
        
        AFTER
        
        fun isPrimeUser(role: UserRole) {
        when (role) {
        UserRole.PRIME -> println("User is PRIME")
        UserRole.REGULAR -> println("User is Regular")
        }
        }
        
        ```
        
    
    => improved readbility, better maintainability, self-documenting code
    
    - Using Named Parameters with Default Values
3. Strategy pattern
    - behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable
    - take a class that does something specific in a lot of different ways and extract all of these
    algorithms into separate classes called strategies
    => use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one
    algorithm to another during runtime
    => Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they
    execute some behavior
    => extensibilty, seperation of concerns, reusability, scalability
