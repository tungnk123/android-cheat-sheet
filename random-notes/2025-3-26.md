1. Protocol Buffer:
	binary -> smaller file
	faster
	hard to read
	schema support (json is not)
	code generation
	multi platform

	more complex
	so new
	No support Browser
	Hard to read

2. gRPC vs REST
	gRPC:
		Protocol Buffer
		HTTP/2.0
		more operation
		need schema, proto file
	REST:
		JSON, XML
		HTTP/1.1
-> gRPC: complex, Microservices, many service, steaming real-time, high performance API,
-> REST: Webservuce, Public API, less service
