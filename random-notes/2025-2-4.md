1. @Inject constructor tells Hilt how to create an instance
2. 10+ Common Kotlin Coroutine Mistakes
    - Blocking the Main Thread: Using Thread.sleep() or blocking calls inside Dispatchers.Main
    => Use delay()
    - Using GlobalScope Indiscriminately
    => Use lifecycleScope or viewModelScope
    - Not Handling Exceptions Properly
    => Use CoroutineExceptionHandler or try-catch for structured error handling
    - Ignoring Structured Concurrency
    => Use coroutineScope or supervisorScope for structured concurrency
    - Misusing [Dispatchers.IO](http://dispatchers.io/) and Dispatchers.Default
    => Use Dispatchers.Default for computational tasks and [Dispatchers.IO](http://dispatchers.io/) for I/O operations
    - Overusing withContext
    => Group-related operations under a single context
    - Forgetting to Cancel Coroutines
    => Cancel coroutines explicitly or use lifecycle-aware scopes
    - Overlooking Coroutine Contexts in Custom Scopes
    => Always provide a context when creating custom scopes
    - Improper Use of async for Launching Tasks
    => Use async when you need results and launch for fire-and-forget operations
    - Not Leveraging Flow for Data Streams
    => Use Kotlin Flow or StateFlow for reactive streams and state management.
    - Misunderstanding launch vs runBlocking
    => Use launch for asynchronous tasks and runBlocking only in tests
3. KDoc:
    - The language used to document Kotlin code
    - KDoc comments start with /** and end with */. Every line of the comment may begin with an asterisk *
    - @param name﻿; @return﻿; @constructor﻿; @receiver﻿; @property name﻿; @throws class, @exception class﻿; @author
4. Android Lint vs Detekt vs Ktlint
    - Android Lint: Detects Android-specific issues, Default, Update XML, Android Compatibility
    - Detekt: Static code analysis for Kotlin, Code quality, Best Practices, Must install manually
    - Ktlint: Enforces Kotlin coding style, Must install manually
5. list.filterIsInstance<ClassName> -> filter specific instance from a list
