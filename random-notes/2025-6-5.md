Kotlin: Don't just use LET for null check
	Recommendation 1.1: When just checking null for an immutable variable, don't use LET.
	It introduce a variable. If you process function is used lots of time, it is doing something extra without any benefits.
	=> just use if (val != null)

	Recommendation 1.2: If you just want to access the checked variable's content, but not the outer scope class' content, don't use LET.
	=> use ?run because it would sent variable as this to the scope


	Recommendation 1.3: If you need to chain the original variable content after the scope, don't use LET.
	=> use ?also
