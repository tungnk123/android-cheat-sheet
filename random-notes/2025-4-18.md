1. Collect StateFlow and SharedFlow Efficiently in Jetpack Compose	
	StateFlow is ideal for managing UI state reactively
	SharedFlow is useful for handling one-time events like navigation or UI messages

	Why Not LiveData? -> Flow benefits
	-> It is part of Kotlin's Flow API, which integrates well with coroutines.
	It provides type-safety and avoids unnecessary recompositions.
	It is more structured and consistent than LiveData when handling state updates in Compose.

	StateFlow is a hot flow that always holds a value and emits updates when the state changes. In Jetpack Compose, it helps to:
		Automatically trigger recomposition when UI state updates.
		Ensure lifecycle-aware state management, avoiding memory leaks.
		Improve performance by avoiding redundant UI updates.

	SharedFlow is the better choice because it does not retain state and emits events only when collected.

	StateFlow itself doesn't trigger recompositions — we need to use collectAsState() to observe it properly inside a 
		Composable function.
	-> convert a StateFlow into a State object 	

	Since SharedFlow doesn't retain values, we need to collect it inside LaunchedEffect to handle events properly.
	LaunchedEffect(Unit) ensures that SharedFlow is collected only once when the composable enters the composition.
	collectAsState() is not meant for SharedFlow (it holds a value, but SharedFlow emits transient events).
	
	Use repeatOnLifecycle to Handle Lifecycle Events
		Prevents memory leaks by automatically stopping collection when the lifecycle is inactive.
		Resumes collection only when needed to save resources.

2. repeatOnLifecycle():
	Kotlin Coroutine API in Android that helps you safely collect flows or run coroutines based on the Lifecycle state 
		(like STARTED, RESUMED, etc.).

	Automatically cancels the coroutine when the lifecycle is below the target state
		→ Helps prevent memory leaks and unnecessary processing, null exceptions

	Restarts the coroutine when the lifecycle comes back to the target state
		→ Useful for things like UI state or event flows that should only update when the UI is visible.

	Cleaner lifecycle-aware code
		→ No need to manually cancel or restart jobs in onStart(), onStop(), etc.


	the problem is not the DESTROYED state — it's the intermediate states, like PAUSED or STOPPED
	->  your UI is not visible, but you're still collecting, processing, doing heavy work.

	Why that's a problem:
		❌ You're updating or referencing views that may not be safe to access (leads to crashes).
		❌ You're collecting data unnecessarily, even when the user isn't seeing it.

	PAUSED = UI is partially or fully hidden, but the component is still active
		Exp:  a transparent dialog or permission popup appears on top
	STOPED = UI is completely hidden
		Exp: you press the Home button.

	STARTED = Visible but not focused
		Exp: Dialog on top, status bar interaction
	RESUMED = Fully visible and active
		Exp: Typing in a form, scrolling a list

3. Dialog with Activity Lifecycle State
	AlertDialog, DialogFragment (same activity)		-> ✅ RESUMED (no lifecycle change)
	System-level dialog (permissions, calls, PiP, etc.)	-> ⚠️ PAUSED (focus lost)
	New activity/dialog theme launched			-> 🛑 STOPPED (if current activity is fully covered)


4. STARTED vs RESUMED
	STARTED:
		Runs when: STARTED or RESUMED
		Paused when: STOPPED or Lower
		UI visible
		Not UI interative
	RESUMED:
		Runs when: RESUMED
		Paused when: PAUSED or lower
		UI visible
		UI interactive
	=> Usecase: User interaction, keyboard, animations
=> Use **STARTED** for most UI-bound flows.

5. Use **RESUMED** only when you need full user focus (input, gestures, SENSOR.).

6. RESUMED is typically best for sensors
	When the app is RESUMED, the user is actively using it.
	When it goes to PAUSED (e.g., incoming call or home button), you want to stop the sensor immediately.
