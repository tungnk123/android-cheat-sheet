Best Practices for Efficient RecyclerView Performance in Android
	1. Use ViewHolder Properly
	2. Avoid Nested Layouts
	-> Consider using a ConstraintLayout or FrameLayout to reduce view hierarchy

	3. Use DiffUtil for Item Changes
	-> use DiffUtil to calculate the difference between old and new data and update only the necessary views

	4. Use Paging for Large Data Sets

	5. Recycle Views Efficiently
	-> avoid heavy operations in onBindViewHolder

	6. Prefetch Data for Smooth Scrolling
	-> Use RecyclerView.setItemViewCacheSize() to prefetch data for upcoming items, reducing lag when scrolling quickly.

	7. Use Stable IDs
	-> better optimize view recycling
	Note: Must override getItemId()

	8. Optimize Image Loading
	-> use an efficient image-loading library like Picasso or Glide

	9. Avoid Memory Leaks
	-> make sure youâ€™re not holding references to activity or fragment contexts

	10. Use ViewBinding or DataBinding

Process Death
	The scenario where the Android system terminates an app's process potentially causing the app to lose its state and restart when
	the user returns. 	
	When: the system needs to reclaim resources (memory) or due to configuration change

3 mistakes in Android Project:
	Mistake 1: Use singleton to store UI state
	-> Process Death
	=> Option 1: Use ViewModel + saveIntanceState
	=> Option 2: Use persistent local storage

	Mistake 2: Dont understand async programming and coroutine
	=> exceeds all api calls in parallel
	=> coroutineScope + async for each api call + await, awaitAll()

	Mistake 3: 

Composition -> Layout -> Drawing


supabase vs firebase:
	supabase:
		 Still evolving, fewer official tools
		No push notifications, offline support, analytic, crashlytics
		 if you need SQL, self-hosting, open-source tools, or a Postgres backend with real-time features.
	firebase:
		rapid development, real-time NoSQL apps, and tight integration with Google services.

Submodule vs Manual module:
	submodule:
		automatic commit tracking
		extra submodule commands needed when cloning
	module:
		manual pulls, no commit tracking
		just git clone
=> precise version control, stay in sync with the upstream often

+, - in a list

startActivityForResult vs registerForActivityResult:
	startActivityForResult:
		legacy, deprecated in API 31+
		need request code
		No lifecycle handling
	registerForActivityResult:
		modern, recommended
		No request code - each launcher is self-contained
		lifecycle-aware, safe across config changes
		Built-in contracts
=> cleaner, safer, lifecycle-aware result handling and to leverage build-in contracts

@Parcelable vs @Serializable:
	@Parcelable:
		code-generated writeToParcel(), createFromParcel()
		-> use @Parcelize
	@Serializable:
		Compile-time plugin generate sezializer for JSON, ProtoBuf
		Null-safety, default values baked in
		Multi-platform
		Muti-format
		Minimal botlerplate code
	-> Not for Intent/Bundle: it serializes to strings or byte arrays, not native Parcels
=> Parcelable with @Parcelize: in Intent/Bundle
=> @Serializable: Json, ProtoBuf for networking or files; Multi-platform
