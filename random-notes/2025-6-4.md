When using WorkManager, how does the system handle constraints like network availability for a OneTimeWorkRequest?
	WorkManager is designed for reliable, deferrable background work. If you define constraints — such as requiring a network 
	connection — the system will delay execution until those constraints are satisfied.
	=> This makes WorkManager ideal for tasks that must run eventually, but not necessarily right away.

	When using constraints, WorkManager automatically holds the task until all conditions are satisfied — ensuring safe and efficient 
	execution, without polling or manual checks.

Which statement about SavedStateHandle is correct?
	-> It is lifecycle-aware and works with ViewModel

	SavedStateHandle is a Jetpack component used in ViewModels to store small amounts of UI-related state. It is designed to survive 
configuration changes like screen rotations, and is lifecycle-aware, meaning it integrates cleanly with the lifecycle of the ViewModel.

	It works alongside the SavedStateViewModelFactory or AbstractSavedStateViewModelFactory to persist and restore values using a 	
		Bundle, typically tied to onSaveInstanceState().
	However, it does not guarantee persistence across process death unless the data is stored explicitly in persistent storage.


What happens when you perform a git cherry-pick?
	=> It applies the changes from another branch without merging the entire branch

	git cherry-pick is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another, without merging the whole branch or bringing in 
	unrelated history.

	This is useful when you want to take just one fix, feature, or change from another branch — without affecting the full commit 
		chain or introducing merge commits.
=> need a specific commit from another branch — without merging the whole branch or rewriting history

Firebase Admin SDK vs FCM
	Firebase Admin SDK
		backend API for Firebase services
		Can send messages to FCM via Admin SDK
		Send FCM push notifications from the backend
		Read/write Firestore and Realtime Database with admin privileges
	FCM:
		Receiver notifications on the device
		Register divice tokens
		Notification/message delivery
		Client (mobile/web apps)
		handle message delivery
=> Admin SDK: Send FCM messages from your server and manage users
=> Firebase client SDK to receiver messages
=> FCM: The mobile app gets an FCM token on launch and displays incoming notifications to the user.
