Clear build in android studio:
	delete all the build output from the previous build inside the build/ folders of your projects and its modules
	(.class files, .dex files, generated .apk file, or .arr files)

	Invalidates caches: clear internal caches (indexing and symbol caches)

Stop using SharedPreferences in the main thread: detect all potential ANRs with Strict Preferences
	all operations potentially involve disk access, which means that if used on the main thread, they can block the UI and 
	cause ANRs (Application Not Responding).

	Strict Preferences = a library that helps you automatically detect any use of SharedPreferences in the main thread

	all operations potentially read and write to disk
	SharedPreferences have an in-memory mechanism that synchronizes the read/write
	=> If we use such operations in the UI thread, they can cause crashes and even ANRs

	The library intercepts all calls to SharedPreferences and checks in which thread they are executed:
		If it is executed from a background thread → it works normally.
		If executed from the main thread → it triggers a StrictMode violation, generates a warning log or throws an 
		exception (depending on the configuration).
	-> Identify insecure access, Anticipate ANR risks, Monitor in production environments

ViewModel lifecycle:
	Activity is tied to the UI, while ViewModel is tied to the scope of the Activity/Fragment and keeps data alive across 
	configuration changes.

	Viewmodel created when:
	Activity finish() -> ViewModel call onCleared()

	Cleared (onCleared()) only when the Activity/Fragment is finished for good or removed from the back stack.
