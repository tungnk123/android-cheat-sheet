1. Google play developer profile
	- 15% fee for first 1M revenue instead of 30%
2. for (i in 0..n - 1) { /*...*/ } // bad 
	- for (i in 0..<n) { /*...*/ } // good
3. Location permission detail:
	- On **Android 12+ (API 31+)**, you should request **both**
	- ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION and ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION → this lets the system show the _“Approximate vs Precise”_ choice
	- On **Android < 12**, only ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION is needed.
	- If you need background location (when the app isn’t open), also request ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION **after** the user grants foreground permission.
	- So keep your code — it’s the right, compatible way to request location permissions.
4. **RecyclerView Anti-Patterns**
	- set bind listener in create or bind holder
	- Solution: set in `init`
