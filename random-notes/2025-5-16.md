1. @Immutable vs @Volatite vs @JvmInline value class
	@Immutable:
		Marks a class as immutable, meaning its data doesn't change after it's created.
		If Compose knows a parameter is immutable, it can skip recomposition when that value is passed in again		
		Jetpack Compose => Helps avoid unnecessary recomposition => optimize performance
		Make sure all properties inside the class are also immutable (like val, not var).
	@Volatile:
		Thread-safe reads/writes of variables
		Makes sure a variable is always read directly from main memory, not from CPU or thread-local cache.
		When one thread changes value, other threads see the updated value immediately.
	@JvmInline:
		Creates efficient value classes
		No object allocation, just raw value

3. Jetpack Compose uses smart recomposition:
	It skips recomposition of unchanged parts of the UI by comparing function parameters and state values.
	But if something changes every time, like a new lambda, Compose assumes that part of the UI needs to update.

	In a LazyColumn, if every item row creates a new clickable lambda on each recomposition, Compose is forced to:
		Recompose every item,
		Reallocate UI elements,
		Redraw things unnecessarily,
		Causing lag, stuttering, or "jank" in long lists.

4. 12 Critical Pitfalls In Jetpack Compose:
	Pitfall #1: Non-Remembered Lambda Functions in Composables
		SEVERE PERFORMANCE PROBLEM: New lambda created on every recomposition
		 TextField(
        		onValueChange = { newText -> 
            			text = newText
        	},
	=> val onValueChange = remember {
        	{ newText: String -> 
            		text = newText
        	}
    	}
	TextField(
        onValueChange = onValueChange)


	Pitfall #2: Lambda Captures in Callbacks and Event Handlers
	=> val onClick = remember(item) {
        		{ onItemClick(item) }
    		}
	=> Remember the lambda with the item as a key
	(Consider key usage in LazyColumn)


	If you see: Modifier.clickable { someFunction(someValue) } => recompose even if someValue is not change
	=> WRONG => val onClick = remember(someValue) { { someFunction(someValue) }}

	
	Pitfall 3, 4, 5: 
	=> Use remember to store big object, expensive computations
	=> Use remember to store inline lambdas
