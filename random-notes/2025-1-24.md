1. Pre-launch report in Play Console
2. **gson** library totally **ignores** your **default** values and uses **0** to complete missing primitive field and **null** instead of missing enum object
=> **gson break kotlin null-safety, enum class, default value**
    
    => Kotlin serialization: data class, sealed class; compile-time safety; performance gain
    
3. **Kotlin serialization** = kotlin oriented cross-platform reflectionless serialization library
    - @Serializable annotation -> compiler will add a special function `serializer()` on your companion object, returning serializer of type `KSerializer`
    - `KSerializer` -> serialize, deserialize data class
    - Format: JSON, ProtoBuf, CBOR
    - Retrofit with Kotlin Serialization Converter
    - Or use `CombinedConverterFactory(
            KotlinxSerializationConverterFactory.create(),
            GsonConverterFactory.create()
        )`
    => incremental migration of endpoints a breeze while keeping our app stable
    - @SerialName(name)
4. Synchronous vs Asynchoronous
    - Synchronous: in sequence, one task at a time -> blocking
    - Asynchoronous: tasks run independently, concurrently -> non-blocking
5. Simplify callbacks using Coroutines
Callbacks involve passing functions to handle asynchronous operations
nested asynchoronous calls -> nested callbacks -> callback hell
=> Coroutine: write asynchronous code in a linear, top-down manner
6. `suspendCancellableCoroutine` API: for oneshot async calls
`callbackFlow` API: convert streaming callback-based APIs to Flow
7. delay() vs Thread.sleep()
    - delay(): dont block the thread -> only suspend the coroutine itself -> thread is return to the pool while the coroutine is waiting -> waiting is done -> coroutine resume on a free thread in the pool
    - Thread.sleep(): block the current Thread
8. yield() -> yield the thread (or thread pool) of the current coroutine dispatcher to other coroutines to run if posible
9. apply false in build.gradle project
    - the plugin is declared at the project level (in the top-level build.gradle.kts) so it can be shared across multiple modules but is not automatically applied to any of the modules
    => apply explicitly the plugin in the module-level
    => centralized plugin management, avoid global application, you apply a plugin only where necessary
    => plugin in project build.gradle have verion; but in module dont need to
