1. The issue is that the SQLite JDBC driver is trying to extract its native library to `C:\WINDOWS\` which requires elevated permissions, and redirecting it to your user temp directory will resolve this.
	- Or run with admin 
2. The fragment currently visible → **RESUMED** Any fragment kept alive by offscreenPageLimit but not visible → **STARTED**
3. **Late-initialized properties and variables**
	dependency injection or inside the setup method of a unit test
	For class properties:
	- You can't declare them in the primary constructor.
	- They must not have a custom getter or setter.
	In all cases, the property or variable must be non-nullable and must not be a [primitive type](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html).
	- `launch([Dispatchers.IO](http://Dispatchers.IO))`: starts a new coroutine on the IO pool, returns a `Job`, no result.
	- `withContext([Dispatchers.IO](http://Dispatchers.IO))`: suspends the current coroutine, runs the block on IO, returns the block’s result.
	- `async([Dispatchers.IO](http://Dispatchers.IO))`: starts a new coroutine that returns a `Deferred<T>`; you get the result via `await()` (structured way to do concurrency).
	**When to use**
	- `**launch(IO)**`: fire-and-forget background work where you don’t need a value back.
	- `**withContext(IO)**`: you need to do IO within a suspend flow and return a value, then resume on the original context.
	- `**async(IO)**`: you want to kick off concurrent tasks that each produce a value and later await them (possibly in parallel).
	Concurrenc
	- `**launch(IO)**`: Runs independently
	- `**withContext(IO)**`: Inline, sequential within caller
	- `**async(IO)**`: Can run many in parallel; await later
	Fire-and-forget on IO => launch
	**Compute on IO and return value (sequential): withContext**
	Parallel requests, then combine: async
	Use `coroutineScope { ... }` (or a structured scope like `viewModelScope`) around multiple `async` calls so they cancel together.
	**Quick rule of thumb**
	- Need a value now → `withContext(IO)`
	- Need to do it in parallel and then combine → `async(IO)` + `await()`
	- Need to just kick off background work tied to a scope → `launch(IO)
