1. ViewModel:
    - hold UI state and business logic
    - lifecycle awareness -> closely tied to the lifecycle of an associated UI controller (Activity, Fragment)
    - retain its data during configuration changes
    - 2 method: onCreate() and onCleared()
    - shared data between fragments
2. ViewModelStore and ViewModelStoreOwner
    - ViewModelStore = container class used to hold and manage instances of ViewModel	
    => associated with the lifecycle of a UI controller
    - a ViewModelStore is created when the associated UI contrller is created
    VD: When an activity is created â†’ a ViewModelStore is also created
    Lifecycle of ViewModelStore is tied to the lifecycle of the UI Controller
    ViewModel added to the ViewModelStore are retained across configuration change
    - Access ViewModelStore through the ViewModelStoreOwner (UI controller itself )
    - use ViewModelProvider -> auto provider interface ViewModelStoreOwner
3. ViewModelOwner = interface that represent an object that can own and provide access to a ViewModelStore
=> implemented by UI Controllers like Activity, Fragment
    - provide a method called getViewModelStore() that allows access to the associated ViewModelStore
    - Any class implementing ViewModelOwner can provide its ViewModelStore
    - ViewModelProvider = utility class used to create and retrieve ViewModels, it need a ViewModelStoreOwner
    to operate
    - ViewModelStore is a container that retains ViewModels, and ViewModelOwner is an interface implemented by UI controllers to provide access to a ViewModelStore
4. Activity Rotation vs Pressing Back Button
Activity Rotation -> ViewModel is alive
Back Button -> finish() -> onDestroy() -> onCleared() -> clear ViewModelStore
=> khi chay lai thi create a new ViewModelStore and new instance of the viewModel
