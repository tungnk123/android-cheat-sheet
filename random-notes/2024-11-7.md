1. **buffer vs queue:**
buffer = temporary memory area used to hold data while itâ€™s being transferred or processed
between different parts of a system.
=> Data transmission with speed mismatches
queue = FIFO data structure
=> Task/data processing that requires sequential order
2. MediatorLiveData
combine 2 or more LiveData into one
    - livedata1.addSource()
    - livedata2.addSource()

4. episodes.firstOrNull() instread of episodes.getOrNull(0)
5. viewModelScope has a Job which is cancelled when the view model is cleared
rememberCoroutineScope() has a Job which is cancelled when the composable exits the composition
