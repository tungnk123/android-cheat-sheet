StateFlow and SharedFlow: The Power of Hot Streams
	StateFlow:
	Represents a mutable state holder. It always has a value, and new collectors receive the current value immediately upon subscription, 
		followed by subsequent updates.
	Ideal for UI state management in ViewModels.

	SharedFlow:
	Designed for broadcasting events or data to multiple consumers. It doesn't hold a state like StateFlow; instead, it distributes 
		emitted values to all active collectors.
	Configurable with replay (how many past values to send to new subscribers) and extraBufferCapacity.
