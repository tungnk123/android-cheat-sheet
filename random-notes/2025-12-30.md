2. Why Cross-Platform Teams Are Shifting to Native
	- **There was a time when the phrase “cross-platform” felt like the future. Startups were pitching it in every investor meeting. CTOs boasted about 40% reduced development costs. And engineers embraced the idea of a single codebase to rule both iOS and Android.**
	- **One Codebase** → Build once, run everywhere.
	-  **Faster Time to Market** → Ship MVPs in weeks, not months.
	- **Lower Team Cost** → No need to hire two full native teams.
	- ## User Experience Now Requires Native APIs
	- ## Maintenance Got Harder Over Time
	- ## Performance and Battery Life Matter Again
	- ## Better Tooling
