1. List.takeIf {it.isNotEmpty() && it.all {ch -> ch.isDigit()}}
2. Service vs Intent Service
Service: Trigger by any thread; Run on MainThread; Block main thread; Stop manually;
IntentService: Trigger by main thread; Run on background thread; auto stop after complete; task queue

4. Multiple Collectors with Flow
Flow: cold + stateless
If you use a cold Flow, multiple collectors behave independently
Each collector starts a new Flow execution
-> The source is re-triggered for every new collector
No shared state -> Each collector gets fresh emissions and does not share data

```
Problem: The source restarts for each collector, which can lead to duplicate work (e.g., duplicate API calls).

```

=> If you want multiple collectors to share the same emissions, use StateFlow or SharedFlow instead of Flow.
=> StateFlow: Best for UI State → Multiple collectors always receive the latest value.
=> SharedFlow: Best for Events (e.g., notifications, one-time actions) → Multiple collectors receive the same event at
the same time.

5. Flow vs StateFlow in ViewModel
Flow:
A cold stream: Starts emitting values only when collected.
Does not retain the last emitted value.
Not lifecycle-aware (needs manual collection in viewModelScope).
Best for one-time events or continuous streams (e.g., API polling, database queries).
StateFlow:
A hot stream: Always holds and emits the latest value.
Requires an initial value at creation.
Works like LiveData but coroutine-friendly.
Ideal for UI state management since it remembers the last value and updates UI when changed.

=> Use Flow for transient data (e.g., API responses, event-based updates).
=> Use StateFlow for UI state management (e.g., form inputs, UI toggles).

6. haredFlow = Multiple collectors can simultaneously receive emissions (like an event bus)
New collectors do not receive past values unless replay is set.
