=> Approach the review with kindness and professionalism. Focus on making the code better, not on pointing out mistakes.
=> Be Constructive: Instead of simply saying, "This is wrong," say something like this, "I think it might be better if we 
	do it this way becauseâ€¦". This will help the other person learn and grow.
