1. sample vs debounce:
	sample: emit periodly
	debounce: quiet after some second and emit that last value

2. Things to know about Flow’s shareIn and stateIn operators
	operators convert cold flows into hot flows
	=> improve performance, add a buffer when collectors are not present, or even as a caching mechanism
	
	The shareIn operator returns a SharedFlow instance whereas stateIn returns a StateFlow
	
	StateFlow is a specialized configuration of SharedFlow optimized for sharing state: the last emitted item is replayed to new 
	collectors, and items are conflated using Any.equals

	the StateFlow interface allows you to access the last emitted value synchronously by reading its value property. 
	That’s not the case with SharedFlow

	These APIs can improve performance by sharing the same instance of the flow to be observed by all collectors instead of 
		creating new instances of the same flow on-demand

	replay in SharedFlow: -> the number of items in memory and re-emit those every time a collector observes the flow

	Caching data: Flow.stateIn caches and replays the last emitted item to a new collector.

	WATCH OUT! Do not create new instances on each function call
		NEVER use shareIn or stateIn to create a new flow that’s returned when calling a function
		=> because it will create a new SharedFlow or StateFlow on each function invocation that will remain in memory until 
		the scope is cancelled or is garbage collected when there are no references to it.

		// DO NOT USE shareIn or stateIn in a function like this.
		fun getUser(): Flow<User> =
        		userLocalDataSource.getUser()
            			.shareIn(externalScope, WhileSubscribed())   

		// DO USE shareIn or stateIn in a property
    		val user: Flow<User> = 
        		userLocalDataSource.getUser().shareIn(externalScope, WhileSubscribed()) 


3. Coroutine Dispatcher mistakes:
	Dispatcher.IO: at least 64 threads
	Dispatcher.Default: same as phone CPU cores => filter, sort, search on a large list
	=> because io operators is depend on the server => idle time can be used for someting else; but CPU tasks is not

	Ktor, DataStore: already implemented the dispatcher logic for their suspend functions -> we dont need to 

	The principle of Main Safety: suspend functions must be safe to be called from main thread

	If the only call inside of the withContext block is a suspending function -> WRONG
	withContext with a suspending function inside -> WRONG
	withContext must be use for a blocking function

4. map vs flatMapLatest in Flow:
	flatMapLatest: each value create a new flow

5. flatMapLatest usecase:
	Search as you type with debounce
		val resultFlow = queryFlow
			.debounce
			.filter {it.isNotBlank()}
			.distinctUntilChangded()
			.flatMapLatest { query -> 
				repostitory.search(query) // Flow<List<Result>>
			}
			.catch { emit(emptyList()) }
			.flowOn(Dispatcher.IO)
	Location update
	Selected item updated -> update detail
