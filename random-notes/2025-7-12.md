	when (animal) {

Function reference:
	:: -> produce a value object that implements a function type
	
	all callable references share the super-type KCallable<R>

	Type of function references:
		top-level; unbound member; bound member; extension; constructor
		property getter; property bound getter; property setter

	Bound vs Unbound:
		val unbound = List<*>::isEmpty // (List<*>) -> Boolean
		val bound = listOf(1, 2)::isEmpty // () -> Boolean

	=> Unbound references need the receiver as their first parameter, bound ones already carry a receiver
=> :: turns any callable into a first-class value that you can store, pass and invoke
=> These are function, 

callbackFlow { … } creates a cold Flow. The builder block runs every time you call a terminal operator such as collect.
	A flow produced with callbackFlow is effectively “single-subscriber” unless you explicitly make it hot.
	
	Why this pattern breaks when the upstream is a single hardware resource
	With the microphone (or any other exclusive resource) each new collection:
		Calls your callbackFlow { … }.
		Tries to start a second AudioRecord (or attaches a second callback to the same one).
	=> Few audio drivers tolerate that, so one of the pipelines stalls or the recorder throws—which is why, in your real app, analysis 
stopped after you changed the preference.
