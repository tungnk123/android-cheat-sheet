1. How to Build Modular Android Apps in 2025 
	Modularization is the practice of breaking your codebase into independent, self-contained components (modules), each 
		responsible for a specific feature or layer of your app.

	app, domain, data, core, feature, baselineProfiles

	-> faster build times, better seperation of concerns, testable, scalable, dynamic delivery (Dynamic Feature modules)

	Let domain be pure and isolated
	Feature modules should never depend on each other -> should only depend on the domain

2. Proto vs JSON: When to Use Which (and Why)
	JSON is like your favourite old t-shirt — comfy, easy, everyone knows it. It’s text-based, human-readable, and universal.
	Proto is like a high-performance racing suit — not as comfy for everyday stuff, but extremely fast and efficient when you need 
		it. It’s binary, not directly human-readable, and you need a bit of setup.

	Json:
		Public APIs
		Quick Prototypes & Side projects
		Human-readable configurations
	Proto:
		High-performance mobile apss -> Smaller size = faster transfers = better user experience
		Microservices Talking to each other
		Realtime systems: gaming, stock trading, live scores, streaming
		IoT devices
=> If humans will see it, prefer JSON. If machines will process it, prefer Proto.
