Kotlin: 6 advance features to make your code clean and reusable
	1. inline Functions with reified Types
		reified -> access the type of a generic parameter at runtime, sidestepping the usual JVM type erasure
		
	2. Seriously Useful Delegated Properties
		Delegated properties let you hand off the logic of a property's getter and setter to another class.
		=> create reusable code for tasks like logging, validation, or transaction management.

	3. Making Your Classes Callable with invoke
		you can make an instance of a class callable as if it were a function

	4. Crafting Your Own Type-Safe DSLs
		

	5. Mastering Variance: in and out
		Generics can get hairy, but Kotlin's declaration-site variance (in/out) makes it manageable
		out (Covariance): The generic type is only produced (output). Think of a read-only list. List<String> is a subtype of 
			List<Any>.
		in (Contravariance): The generic type is only consumed (input). Comparable<Any> is a subtype of Comparable<String>.

	6. typealias for Cleaner, Saner Code
