1. 10 Android Best Practices Every Developer Should Follow in 2025
	Use Kotlin Everywhere
	Build with Jetpack Libraries: Navigation, Room, WorkManager, DataStore
	Stick to a Scalable Architecture: MVVM, MVI, clean Architecture
	Avoid God Activities & Fragments -> delegate
	Use Dependency Injection -> Testing, scaling, refactoring
	Modularize Your Codebase -> multi module project -> core, network, feature module
	Say Goodbye to findViewById -> ViewBinding, Jetpack Compose
	Optimize Gradle for Speed -> Tweak your gradle.properties, enable configuration cache, and keep your modules focused
	Manage State the Right Way
	Test Smartly (But Do Test)
	-> Not every app needs 100% test coverage. But please — test your ViewModels, your use cases, your critical flows. 
		You’ll catch bugs early and sleep better at night.

2. How would you structure a large multi-feature Android app from scratch?
	:app (only for launching)
	:core (common utils, design system)
	:feature:login, :feature:home, etc.
	:data (repositories, sources)
	:domain (use cases, business logic
	Layered with Clean Architecture:
		Presentation: ViewModels, UI state, navigation
		Domain: Use cases, interfaces (independent of Android)
		Data: Implementations of repositories, API, and local storage
	-> Use dependency injection (like Hilt or Koin), consistent UI state handling (sealed classes or MVI), and navigation 
		abstraction (navigation graph or custom router).

3. State Encapsulation in ViewModel:
	private val _contacts = MutableStateFlow<List<Contact>>(emptyList())
    val contacts: StateFlow<List<Contact>> = _contacts

	=> Encapsulation: Keeps the logic for updating state inside the ViewModel only.
	=> Prevents bugs: UI shouldn’t be able to change internal data – this separation enforces one-way data flow.
	=> Clean Architecture: It follows MVVM best practices – making code easier to test, debug, and maintain.
