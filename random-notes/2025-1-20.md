1. add tag, create release in git
2. buildString {
    if (abc )append("text")
    append(text)
}
3. SOAP vs REST API
SOAP = a protocol that defines a strict set of rules for exchanging structured information in web services.
=> XML only, slower, less flexible; use WS security
=> Enterprise apps, banking, legacy systems
(You need strict standards and security (e.g., in banking, financial, or government systems).)
RESTful API = an architectural style that uses standard web protocols and principles to allow communication between
systems.
=> REST is not a protocol but a set of guidelines; faster; simple and intuitive; highly flexible
=> mobile/web apps, public APIs
4. Serialization is the process of converting data used by an application to a format that can be transferred over a network
or stored in a database or a file.
In turn, deserialization is the opposite process of reading data from an external source and converting it into a
runtime object.
5. kotlinx.serialization vs gson vs Moshi
kotlinx.serialzation: Kotlin; fast (compile-time code gen); Reflection-free; multiplatform; use @Serializable
=> code generation is done at compile time instead of run time (with reflection)
gson: Kotlin and Java; slower due to reflection; no annotation; easy
moshi: Kotlin and Java; slower; @JsonClass, @Json

=> kotlinx.serialization: Kotlin-first project or KMP; Performance-critical applications; lightweight serialization
with Kotlin-specific features.
=> Gson: legacy project; use java
=> Moshi: modern android apps; need better performance than Gson but want some reflection-based flexibility;
Ideal if you already already use other Square libraries like Retrofit (Moshi integrates seamlessly)

6. Kotlin Serilzation benefit:
use compile-time code generation to handle serilization and deserialization => more performance
support kotlin-specific constructs like: default values, nullable types, sealed classes, type safety
multiple platform support
no reflection is used -> fast, lightweight
7. @Serializable in Kotlin Serialization vs Serializable Interface
    - @Serializable: JSON, Protobuf, CBOR; No reflection
    - Serializable Interface: Binary serialization (byte stream); Use reflection; slower; no third-party needed
8. Send data with Intent:
    - @Serializable: Faster than Serializable, but slower than Parcelable; Simple, Kotlin-native; requires plugin; codegen at compile time
    - Parcelable with @Parcelize: Fast (optimized for Android) ;Easy, just implement interface
    - Serializable Interface: Slow (reflection-based); Boilerplate code (or use @Parcelize);
    codegen at compile time with @Parcelize

=> Use Parcelable for most Android projects, especially if performance and memory efficiency are important.
=> Use @Serializable if your project already leverages kotlinx.serialization or if youâ€™re working on a Kotlin Multiplatform project.
=> Use Serializable only for quick prototypes, legacy code, or when you prioritize simplicity over performance.

9. Inline + reified:
    - `inline`: Enables inlining of the function to remove the **overhead** ``of the function call.Required to use reified.
    - `reified`: Allows **accessing the actual type T at runtime.** (or need to use class<T>)
    Simplifies JSON serialization/deserialization without needing to pass a Class<T> explicitly.
