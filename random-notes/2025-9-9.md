In Android: every app = one Linux process with User ID (from Zygote) + at least one UI thread.

Don’t Make Your ViewModels Do Everything — There’s a Better Way
	Hold and expose UI state
	Coordinate async actions
	Emit UI events
	Delegate logic to other layers


From Retrofit to Ktorfit, on the way to Kotlin Multiplatform
	Multiplatform compatibility, Reduced dependencies, Greater control and flexibility

	@SerializedName in Gson vs @SerialName in kotlinx.serialization

	Ktorfit = HTTP client/Kotlin Symbol Processor for Kotlin Multiplatform (Js, Jvm, Android, iOS, Linux) that uses KSP and 
		Ktor clients inspired by Retrofit

	By leveraging Ktor’s multiplatform compatibility, you can create more flexible applications that are less dependent on 
		Android-specific libraries.

Internal storage (private to your app)
 	Root dirs:
 	context.filesDir → persistent files (backed up by Auto Backup).
 	context.cacheDir → temporary; system may wipe anytime; not backed up.
 	context.codeCacheDir → compiled caches (Dex/JS etc).
 	context.noBackupFilesDir → not backed up (kept on device).
 	No permissions needed. Removed on uninstall.
External storage – app-specific (scoped)
 	Root dirs (per app, removed on uninstall; no permission):
 	context.getExternalFilesDir(type) → persistent, user-visible in storage (e.g. Environment.DIRECTORY_MUSIC, PICTURES, DOWNLOADS, or null for root).
 	context.externalCacheDir → temp cache on external
 	context.externalMediaDirs → app media dirs (multi-storage devices).
 	Still private to your app’s UID (other apps can’t read without SAF/permissions), but user can see/manage via file managers.
External shared (for user/global libraries)
 	Use MediaStore (photos/videos/audio/downloads) or SAF (Storage Access Framework) to create files meant to be shared/visible outside your app.
 	Runtime permissions vary by type/SDssK (e.g., READ_MEDIA_* on Android 13+; WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deprecated).

=> 	Secrets / configs / DBs → filesDir (or Room’s default internal DB path).
	Temp files → cacheDir (or externalCacheDir if you need more space).
	Large user-visible but app-specific files (e.g., downloaded recitations only your app uses) → getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_MUSIC) (or another suitable type).
	User-shared media (photos/audio the user might browse in Gallery/Music) → MediaStore.
 	Stuff you don’t want backed up (e.g., re-downloadable caches) → noBackupFilesDir (or any cache dir).
