Scope functions: all is high order function (inline), with is not extension functions -> TOP-LEVEL functions
	let
		object reference inside block -> it
		return -> last expression
	=> transform, check null
	run
		object reference inside block -> this
		return -> last expression
	=> compute something, return value
	with(object)
		object reference inside block -> this
		return -> last expression
	=> many calls on object
	apply
		object reference inside block -> this
		return -> the object itself
	=> build/ configure object
	also
		object reference inside block -> it
		return -> the objec itself
	=> side-effect, debugging, logging
=> Need the result of the block -> let, run, or with
=> Need the original object back -> apply, also
=> Need "this" for cleaner member calls -> run, with, apply
=> Logging, Debugging -> also

=> Use it -> let, also
