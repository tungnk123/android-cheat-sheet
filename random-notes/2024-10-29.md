- Atomic commits
    - Atomic, small git commits: does one thing, one simple sentence
    - Benefist:
        - Easy revert
        - Clear git history
        - Easy code review
        - Break down big problems to smaller problems
- Task
    
    Task = a collection of metadata and information around a stack of activities
    => tap launcher icon -> system look for a previously existing task (determined by the Intent and Activity
    it points to) to resume
    => if no existing task -> create a new task with newly launched activity as the base activity
    
- Backstack
    - Backstack = stack of activity, relate with back button
    Backstack with fragments
    addToBackStack() to add FragmentTransaction to backstack
    - use launchMode = singletop or flag Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP
- **Deferred** interface implements **Job** interface; **Deferred** is also an instance of **Job** but with a result.
- Fragment Lifecycle:
    
    onAttach() -> fragment instance is associated with an activity -> reference to the activity
    onCreate() -> load data, retain data using savedInstanceState
    onCreateView() -> return root view of layout, create view hierarchy of the fragment
    onActivityCreated() -> signifies that the activity is fully created	
    onStart() -> fragment become visible
    onResume() -> fragment become interative
    onDestroyView() -> view hierarchy is being removed
    onDestroy() -> clean up resource, states associated with the fragment
    onDetach() -> detach fragment from the activity
    => no memory leak
