1. coroutine leak = dangling coroutine = zombie state coroutine
a coroutine continues to run after it should be cancelled, often because the reference to the coroutine is
retained beyond its useful lifetime
2. To prevent coroutine leaks:
Use scoped coroutines such as lifecycleScope or viewModelScope in Android.
Properly handle coroutine cancellation by ensuring all coroutines are canceled when the lifecycle or scope ends.
Avoid launching coroutines in the global scope where they may outlive the parent component.
What happens when you mix runBlocking and launch in the same coroutine scope? Can this result in a deadlock or any other
issues?
->  Mixing runBlocking and launch within the same scope can lead to deadlocks, especially if runBlocking is used on
the main thread and the launched coroutine attempts to perform work on the same thread
3. What happens to Thread.currentThread() inside a coroutine? What about using [Dispatchers.IO](http://dispatchers.io/) and Dispatchers.Main?
-> When using Thread.currentThread() inside a coroutine, the returned thread depends on the dispatcher that the coroutine
is using:
[Dispatchers.IO](http://dispatchers.io/): The thread returned will be from the IO thread pool, designed for offloading blocking IO tasks.
Dispatchers.Main: In Android or UI-based applications, it will return the main thread (UI thread).
4. Explain the behavior of coroutines when the parent scope is cancelled. What happens to child coroutines in supervisorScope
vs coroutineScope?
-> coroutineScope: Cancelling the parent coroutine will cancel all child coroutines within that scope. If any child
coroutine fails or is cancelled, the parent scope will not proceed until all child coroutines are completed
-> supervisorScope: In contrast, if a child coroutine fails or is cancelled, other child coroutines will continue executing.
It allows independent handling of failure in child coroutines without affecting others.
5. @Transaction:
manage database transactions in Dao
Ensure atomicity: single transaction
Handle complex queries: require multiples database operations
Prevent inconsistent data: because entire methods run in a transaction
6. LiveData.switchMap vs LiveData.map:
LiveData.switchMap: switch to new Livedata; load new LiveData dynaicly
LiveData.map: transform emitted data; modify data; previous daa retained
=> Use map when you only need to modify the data in LiveData
Map: 	change the data inside Livedata without changing the source
everytime the source LiveData updates, the transormation is applied
=> Use switchMap when you need to fetch new Livedata dynamically ()
SwitchMap:
switch from one LiveData to another
When the original LiveData changes, a new LiveData is created, and the previous one is ignored.
7. StateFlow: -> the latest cached value immediately
Recomputes on each collection? No (uses latest cached value)
Multiple collectors share same value	
The UI needs the latest cached value immediately (e.g., when screen rotates).
Multiple UI components need to observe the same state.
You want to avoid recomputation when a new collector starts.
You need to persist state across recompositions (Jetpack Compose or Fragment recreation).
