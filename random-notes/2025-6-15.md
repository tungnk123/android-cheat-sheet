	WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables bi-directional, full-duplex communication over a single TCP connection.
	WebSocket with Ktor + Kotlin Flow	

	Reconnect logic: Use retryWhen or exponential backoff on failure.
	Lifecycle awareness: Manage WebSocket sessions in ViewModel and clean up in onCleared().
	Secure connections: Always prefer wss:// over ws:// for production apps.
	Error handling: Wrap socket logic in try-catch and emit errors via Flow or a shared UI state.
