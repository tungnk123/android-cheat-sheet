Question 1: When a Kotlin object stops being a singleton
	A common case is JSON serialization. Libraries like Gson don't recognize Kotlin's object.

	Kotlin object guarantees a single instance within the same classloader — but only at the language level. 

	Runtime tools like Gson don't enforce this behavior. They reconstruct objects based on structure, not identity.

	Unlike Gson, Kotlin serialization recognizes Kotlin's object. 
	=> When you deserialize a @Serializable object, it doesn't create a new instance — it returns the original singleton.
