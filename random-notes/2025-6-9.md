ChartWrapperView
val chartIndex = ((requestedIndex % size) + size) % size

post vs doOnLayout
	post:
		queue up a Runnable to run on the UI thread after the view is attached
		Not guarantee that your view's measurements/layout pass have completed
		=> view.height and view.width may still be zero
	doOnLayout:
		wait until after the view has been measured and laid out
		=> you are certain its size and positions are valid
=> post: run on UI thread soon, and you don't care about exact sizes
=> doOnLayout: need actual measured dimensions (building a shader that depends on chart height)

Avoid using lambda in the data class constructor in Kotlin
	Avoid use var and Array in data class
	=> lead to unexpected behavior and subtle bugs (relate to how equals(), hashCode(), copy())

	Even if two lambdas do exactly the same thing, they are treated as different objects.
	=> This breaks equality and can lead to subtle bugs when storing or comparing instances.

	lambdas in Kotlin are compared by reference => each lambda creates a new object in memory

	Lambdas are compared by reference
	This can break equals() and hashCode()
	It may lead to subtle issues in lists, caching, or UI state updates
