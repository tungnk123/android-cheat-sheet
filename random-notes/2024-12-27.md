1. Use the Factory Pattern if the number of object types is small and unlikely to change.
Use the Factory Method Pattern if you need scalability and expect frequent changes to object creation logic.
2. Factory vs Factory method
Factory: Centralized in one factory class, Typically hardcoded logic, Less flexible, Simpler to implement
=> When the types of objects are limited or static
Factory method: Delegated to subclasses, Dynamic via polymorphism, More flexible, More complex
=> When new types need to be added frequently
3. Git commands
    - HEAD pointer
    - staging area: git add .
    - git checkout -b branchName
    - git branch -d branchName
    - git commit --amend -m 'message'
    - git reset --soft HEAD^: preserving all your changes in the staging area
    - git reset --mixed HEAD^: default behaviour,  un-commits the last commit and removes its changes from the staging area
    => keep in working directory
    - git reset --hard HEAD^: It completely erases the last commit along with all the associated changes from your Git history
