viewModels() vs activityViewModels()
	viewModels: use for activity host fragments

	activityViewModel: just use for fragment

viewModels() → local to Activity or Fragment.

 activityViewModels() → shared across Fragments in the same Activity.

 In Activities → always use viewModels().

 In Fragments → use activityViewModels() only when sharing data.

Middle Man code smell: a class or method acts as a simple intermediary, forwarding calls to another class or method without adding any meaningful behavior or logic of its own
=:> Use inline variables and inline functions

Inline variable refactoring 
Apply Inline Variable when a variable is only used once or when its name does not add any meaningful information. If the variable does not contribute to code readability or logic, it can be inlined.
Ctrl + Shift + N -> Inline
val fileExists = File(path).exists()
if (!fileExists) 
If the method has become redundant or does not add significant value, it can be safely inlined.
