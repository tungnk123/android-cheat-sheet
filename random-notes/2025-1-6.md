1. An extension function in Kotlin allows you to add new functionality to existing classes without modifying their source code.
2. A type alias in Kotlin is a way to provide an alternative name for an existing type.
It doesnâ€™t create a new type but allows you to refer to an existing type with a different name.
Exp: typealias GroupedContacts = Map<String, List<ContactModel>>
3. **infix** functions are a special type of function that allows you to call the function in a more **natural**, **readable** way, **similar to an operator**
=> you can call them without using the usual dot (.) notation or parentheses
4. The by keyword is used for delegation, which allows one object to delegate certain functionality to another object.
5. The by keyword helps reduce boilerplate and allows reusing functionality without having to implement it from scratch
    - Delegating properties: You can delegate the behavior of a property to another object (for example, using by lazy)
    - Delegating interfaces: You can delegate the implementation of an interface to another object, which can reduce code duplication.
6. To use onResume in Jetpack Compose

    - LaunchedEffect
    - LifecycleEventObserver
    - use LifeCycle Runtime Compose: LifecycleEventEffect(Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME)
7. UsbManager + BluetoothAdapter
8. **Clean Architecture and package-by-feature**
9. **Package by feature:** Every package contains files related to each other
10. All the view models have a ResourceProvider dependency
=> get strings, drawbles, colors from the resources without having to use a context
