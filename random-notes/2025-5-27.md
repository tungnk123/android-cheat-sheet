conflate() in Flow:
	skip intermediate emissions if the collector can't keep up, only delivering the most recent value when it's ready again
	without conflate(): every emitted item is bufferd -> back-pressured and sent to the collector in order
	with conflate():  if the collector is busy (heady UI work or chart drawing) -> the flow will drop any new emissions until the collector
		is free -> then immediately emit the lasted value
=> Usecase: UI rendering, sensor streams, network pings, something run faster than UI-update
=> one continious data stream and want to skip intermediate value if the consumer is slow, but you are not starting new tasks per item

conflate() vs flatMapLattest():
	conflate():
		skip intermediate values if the consumer is slow, but you are not starting new tasks per item
	flatMapLattest():
		for each upstream emission -> launch a new inner flow
		if a new upstream value arrives before the previous inner flow completes -> it cancels the previous one and switches to 
	the new inner flow
	=> when each upstream item drives a new asynchronous operation (an inner flow) and you want to cancel any previous operation as 
	soon as a fresh input arrives

Injecting the Applicaition Context into repository is common and recommended pattern:
	@ApplicaitionContext context = lives as long as your app does and cannot leak UI objects
	Never hold an Activity or Fragment context in a long-lived singletion -> memory leaks nad unwanted lifecycle coupling

StateFlow vs SharedFlow in Service + Repository:
	Service -> StateFlow: Let the service own a StateFlow for its internal state
	Repo -> SharedFlow(replay = 1):
		a hot, multicast stream 	
		replay of the last real event, no dummy initial value
		decoupling: the repo simply relays events, it isn't the source of truth
=> StateFlow: when you own the state and want an always-available .value
=> SharedFlow(replay = 1): when you purely broadcasting real events and want the late subscribers to get the most recent one without	
	inventing an initial value => event broadcaster instead of stateholder
