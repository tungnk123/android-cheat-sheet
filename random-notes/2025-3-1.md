1. Abstract class vs interface
    - Abstract class:
        - Can have both abstract and concrete methods
        - Can have constructors
        - Can have instance variables
        - Can have private, protected, or public methods
        single inheritance
        => Used when different classes share some common behavior
        => share common code among multiple related classes.
    - Interface:
        - Only abstract methods (before Java 8), but can have default & static methods (Java 8+)
        - Cannot have constructors
        - Only public static final variables (constants)
        - Only public methods (before Java 9) multiple inheritance
        => Used when defining a contract that multiple classes can follow
        => define a common contract for multiple unrelated classes.
2. Abstract class generalize behavior
Interface standardize behavior -> contract
3. flatMapConcat vs flatMapMerge vs flatMapLatest
    - flatMapConcat:
        - lining up tasks in a queue
        - sequential operations
    - flatMapMerge:
        - asynchronous operation, where each flow is started into a new coroutine scope so they can process parallel running tasks
        - DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY = parallel tasks can run
    - flatMapLatest:
        - It forgets about the previous flow once a new one appears
4. Simple Factory vs Factory Method vs Abstract Factory:
    - Simple Factory:
        - a separate class (Factory) is used to create objects based on some input or condition
        - Provides a single method to create objects.
        - Not a true "design pattern" but a simple way to organize object creation.
        - Object Creation: Centralized in one class
    - Factory Method:
        - relies on subclasses to define the object creation logic.
        - Uses inheritance: Each subclass implements its own factory method.
        - Supports Open-Closed Principle (new products can be added without modifying the factory).
        - More flexible;  Open-Closed Principle: New shapes can be added without modifying existing code.
        - One subclass create one object
        - Object Creation: Delegated to subclasses
    - Abstract Factory:
        - provides an interface to create a family of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
        - e.g. UI elements in Mac/Windows
        - Best for related objects
        - Uses multiple factories
        - Object Creation: Multiple factories for related objects
        - A factoty create multiple objects
        => Abstract Factory is best when dealing with families of related objects.
