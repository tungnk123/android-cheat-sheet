1. Splash:
	show logo, branding
	preload important data: login, config, theme, locale
	-> determine next screen

2. At its simplest, a cache is nothing more than a key-value store with a getter and setter.
	The real power comes when we are able to compose two caches into a new cache
	val cache = memoryCache.compose(diskCache)

	By default, Cache has an unlimited number of entries which never expire
	But a cache can be configured to support both time-based expirations and size-based evictions

	Time-based expirations: Expiration time can be specified for entries in the cache.

	Size-based evictions: set the maximum number of entries to be kept in the cache


3. Interceptor in OkHttp
	interceptor = component that allows you to inspect, modify or short-circut HTTP request and responses
	=> Middleware that processes HTTP requests/responses.
	=> Add headers; Log requests/responses; Modify caching behavior; Retry or handle errors

	chain = Pipeline that passes request & response through interceptors
	chain.request() = The original HTTP request
	chain.proceed(request) = Tells OkHttp to continue processing the request
	response = The HTTP response after the request has been processed

4. Force Cache Interceptor in OkHttp
	Force cache Interceptor = custom Interceptor that forces OkHttp to use its cache, even when the server does not provide
		cache headers (Cache-Control, ETag)
	=> fake Cache-Control header -> OkHttp can store and reuse the response

5. Use ScalarConverter before Json Converter -> handle plain text before json handle
	.addConverterFactory(ScalarsConverterFactory.create())
        .addConverterFactory(json.asConverterFactory(contentType))

6. Try/catch vs viewModelScope
	Try/cacth outside of launch {}
=> does not catch any exceptions thrown inside the coroutine (launch block). That’s because launch {} is asynchronous — the 
	try-catch outside only wraps the launch itself, not the code running inside it.
	(try-catch outside of it finishes executing before the coroutine even runs, so it doesn't catch anything from inside)
	=> exceptions occur in a different thread
	=>  Put try-catch inside the coroutine
	=>  Alternative: Use runCatching (cleaner syntax)

7. HTTP cache:
	Controlled by a combination of request headers and response headers

	Request Header: stick with the defaults (usually)
		the browser almost always takes care of setting them on your behalf when it makes requests
		Request headers that affect checking for freshness, like If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since appear based on 
		the browser's understanding of the current values in the HTTP Cache

	Response headers: configure your web server
		Cache-Control. The server can return a Cache-Control directive to specify how, and for how long, the browser 
			and other intermediate caches should cache the individual response.
		ETag. When the browser finds an expired cached response, it can send a small token (usually a hash of the 
			file's contents) to the server to check if the file has changed. If the server returns the same token, then the file is the same, and there's no need to re-download it.
		Last-Modified. This header serves the same purpose as ETag, but uses a time-based strategy to determine if a 
			resource has changed, as opposed to the content-based strategy of ETag.

	Cache-Control: 
		no-value: This instructs the browser that it must revalidate with the server every time before using a 
			cached version of the URL
		no-store: This instructs the browser and other intermediate caches (like CDNs) to never store any version of 
			the file
		private: Browsers can cache the file but intermediate caches cannot
		public: The response can be stored by any cache
	

8. Try/catch vs runCaching()/Result:
	try/cacth:
		can handle specific exception
		keep code that handle it close to the risky code
	=> Try/catch: catch specific exception or need to emphasize the exception-handling part of it 
	=> Use Either from ArrowKt library

	Always prefer try catch (e: Exception) over runCatching().
	Reason is runCatching catches all sorts of Throwable that you might not want to catch.
		
9. CoroutineExceptionHandler:
	Just work with corouine that dont return a result, like launch
	=> async must use try-catch on await()

10. launch -> create a Coroutine and return a Job immediately
	-> try/catch wrap the call to launch -> not the code inside the coroutine
	-> coroutine runs asynchronously, likely after the try/catch block has already exited

	-> exceptions inside coroutines are handled separately -> they don't bubble up the calling thread like normal synchronous
		code

11. Coroutine dont bubble exceptions to caller
	-> do not tied to the call tack of the caller once launched
	-> avoid crashing the main thread when background coroutines fail
	=> Coroutines are not tied to the main thread's call once launched

12. Navigation component benefits:
	Auto-managed back stack handling
	Safe argument passing
	Built-in deeplink
	Easy nav intergration with XML/binding
	Configurable Animations/Transactions
	Bottom nav, Drawer Nav
=> Best for medium-large apss, need learning-curve

13. ViewPager2 vs Navigation Component
	ViewPager2 pros:
		smooth swipe transitions
		fragments preload in memory
		simple structure
		easy tablayout intergration
	ViewPager2 cons:
		No back stack
		No deeplink
		fragment lifecycle gets messy: preload adjacent fragments by default
		-> harder to handle data loading or analytic per screen
		no safe args	
		increase memory usage: multiple fragment are preloaded
