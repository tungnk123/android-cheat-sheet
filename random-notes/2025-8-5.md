	hour = seconds / 3600
	minute = (seconds % 3600) / 60
	second = second % 60

	itemView.context.getString

Collect Flows only when needed — avoid nested collect and don’t block inside them.
Nested collect calls, Unnecessary re-collection -> bug -> Only collects each flow once via .first()
Avoid nested collect.Instead, use:
 	combine(flowA, flowB) { a, b -> ... }
 	flatMapLatest
 	collectLatest for cancellation
 	first() if you just need the latest value once, You don’t need to react to changes afterward
=> One-time load on screen start: use first()
=> Real-time updates: use flatMapLattest()
