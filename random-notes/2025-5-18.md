Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) Principle in Android: Kotlin and Jetpack Compose Best Practices
	=> Easy to read and understand at a glance; Simple to debug and maintain
	Focused on the actual problem rather than clever workarounds; ree from unnecessary layers, abstractions, or magic tricks

	Readable Function Names Instead of Comments
	Simple Conditionals Over Complex Boolean Logic: use when + smart cast

	Extension Functions for Clarity, Not Complexity
	=-> create each extension function for each operation instead of chain them 

	Data Handling with Simple Types
	=> Prefer simple data structures over complex nested objects when appropriate
	=> flatter structure when appropriate

	Focused Composable Functions
	=> Create composables that do one thing well, rather than trying to handle too many cases

	fun onIntent(intent: UserIntent) {
        when (intent) {
            is UserIntent.LoadUser -> loadUser(intent.id)
        	}
    	}
