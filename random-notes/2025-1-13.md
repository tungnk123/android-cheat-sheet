1. debounce vs sample in kotlin flow
    - `debounce`: emit a new value if no value is emitted after timeout -> autocomplete suggestion, search bar
    - `sample`: emit value after a specific time out -> get value from db with delay
    
    => **Sample periodically samples the latest value emitted by the flow within a specified time interval**
    
2. FloatingWidget with foreground service
    - Service dont have a UI
    => Window Manager show UI, not Service
    - `WindowManager` = api in android system, allow to draw view into screen without a activity
    (need **TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY**)
3. Adb:
    - client-server architecture
    - `adb client:` command line running in laptop
    - `adb daemon:` process running in android app
    - `adb server:` service running in laptopn to communicate between adb client and adb daemon

```
adb client -> adb server -> adb daemon
```

4. val filteredData = all.**filterNot** { data ->
    sensitiveWords.**any** { sensitiveWord ->
          [data.name?.contains](http://data.name/?.contains)(sensitiveWord, ignoreCase = true) ?: false
    }
}
5. NotificationManager vs NotificationChannel vs NotificationCompat.Builder
6. **Ensure the notification channel is created before you attempt to use it in foreground service**
7. **SmartCast**: The `as?` operator returns null if the cast is not possible, instead of throwing a ClassCastException
8. `isNullOrEmpty()` is a null-safe function that works on nullable types (T?).
9. Notification.setOnGoing(true) -> persistent, indicate ongoing work, non-dismissible by user
10. `Intent.resolveActivity(packageManager) != null`
resolveActivity -> Return the Activity component that should be used to handle this intent.
11. Android device have a adb server, but enable USB/Wireless Debugging
12. **adb pair vs adb connect**
    - adb pair: Authenticate (authorize) the computer with the Android device; require first time
    - adb connect: Establish the wireless ADB connection; dont require if already paired
    
    => **must adb pair <ipaddr>:<pair_port> first then adb connect <ipaddrr>:<connect_port>
    (pair port != connect port)**
