1. 10 Coding Practices Every Senior Developer Swears By
	Write Code Like It’s Going to be Reviewed by Your Future Self
	-> paying attention to structure, meaningful comments, and logical flow
	Name Things Well. Yes, It Matters
	DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), but Avoid “Magic”
	Comment for the “Why,” Not the “What”
	Single Responsibility Principle: Keep Functions Focused
	-> A method should do one thing, and do it well
	Version Control is Not Optional (and Commit with Care)
	Handle Errors Gracefully (Because Crashes are Unprofessional)
	-> In the good example, the error is logged for debugging, and a user-friendly message is displayed to the user
	Write Tests. (Yes, Really Write Them)
	-> Tests prevent regression, keep features safe, and provide confidence to refactor.
	Be Mindful of Dependencies
	Refactor Regularly and Ruthlessly
