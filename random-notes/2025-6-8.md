Cracking the Interview: Multiple Threads and Interview Questions in Android
	performing heavy tasks on the main thread can cause UI freezing or application crashes, as it can't respond to user actions while 
	processing those tasks.

	Offload these tasks to background threads, allowing the main thread to remain responsive and providing a smooth user experience.
	
	Usecases: Network, database, heavy computations, animations 
	
	Solution:
	1. Java Thread: Basic way to create a background thread
		Thread backgroundThread = new Thread(new Runnable() { run()}

	2. AsyncTask: Deprecated in Android 11, but still important for legacy apps
		private class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String> {
		@Override
    		protected String doInBackground(Void... voids) {}

		@Override
    		protected void onPostExecute(String result) {}

	3. ExecutorService: A more powerful and flexible option
	=> managing a pool of threads

	4. HandlerThread: For tasks that require a looper (i.e., managing messages or runnable tasks)

	5. Coroutines (Kotlin): Modern, highly recommended for Kotlin developers.


	Best Practices When Using Threads in Android
		Don't Block the Main Thread: Always move long-running tasks off the main thread.
		Use the Appropriate Threading Tool: Choose between Thread, ExecutorService, or Coroutines based on the complexity of the task.
		Manage UI Updates Properly: Ensure you update the UI only on the main thread. Use runOnUiThread() or 
			withContext(Dispatchers.Main) for coroutines.
		Avoid Memory Leaks: Always cancel threads when they are no longer needed. With coroutines, ensure you handle cancellations properly in lifecycle-aware components like ViewModel.
		Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to deal with failed background tasks, especially for network calls.
