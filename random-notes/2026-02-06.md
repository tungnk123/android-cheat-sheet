1. **🔹 Concise Knowledge Summary**
	- **Room** `**@Upsert**`
	- Updates **only when the PRIMARY KEY matches**
	    
	- **Does NOT** update based on a `unique index`
	    
	- To update by `phoneNumber`, you must use a **separate UPDATE query**
	    
	
	- **Correct way to update a contact**
	    
	
	- Use `UPDATE contacts SET name = ... WHERE phoneNumber = ...`
	    
	- Return `Int` to know whether a row was updated
	    
	
	- **Unique index vs Primary Key**
	    
	
	- `unique index` → prevents duplicates
	    
	- `primary key` → what Room uses for UPDATE vs INSERT
	    
	- `@Upsert` checks **only the primary key**
	
	- **Database Inspector**
	    
	- Often becomes **read-only** with Room + Flow + WAL
	    
	- UI delete is unreliable → use **SQL console**
	    
	- **Android data management tools**
	- No desktop “all-in-one” tool for:
		- Room 
		- SharedPreferences
		- DataStore
	- This is **by design** (sandbox + security)
	- **Only valid all-in-one solution**
	- **Debug-only in-app admin screen**
	    
	- Enabled only in `debug / internal`
	    
	- Completely excluded from release (Play-safe)

	- **Google Maps direction cone**
		- `GroundOverlay` fails at very low zoom (gets culled)
		- Not suitable for global scale
		- Correct solution = **Polygon (LatLng)**
		- Or hide cone at low zoom levels
	👉 **Key takeaway**:
	
	Most issues are **by design, not bugs**—understanding platform constraints is essential.
