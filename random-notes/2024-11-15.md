1. **Clean code**:
    - effectiveness, efficiency and simplicity
    - consistent formatting and syntax: name conventions, indenation and spacing,..
    - naming: clearly, descriptively
    - SRP = single responsibility = a class, function or module should have only one reason to change
    => easy to test, reuse, refactor
    - Single Source of Truth = there is only one place where a particular piece of data or configutation is stored in the codebase
    - Only expose and consume data you need
    - Modularization = breaking down large, complex code into smaller, more manageable modules or functions.
    => reusability, encapsulation, scalability
    - documentation
2. Repository pattern
    - abstract data access logic frim the business logic layer
    - encapsulate data access details and create a clean API for querying and saving data
    - acts as a mediator between the data source (database, network, file storage) and business logic
    - Encapsulation: hide complex queries or connection details
    - Clean interface: clear, simple interface for data access without exposing the underlying implementation
    - Centralized access: Centralizes data access logic, which helps with code organization and consistency

```
=> more maintainable, testable, flexible

```

3. **CompositionLocal** = provides a way to pass data down the composable tree without explicitly passing it as parameters to every composable
4. Optimize performance in Jetpack compose
    - avoid unnecessary recompositions
    - use lazy layouts
    - optimize custom composables for efficiency
5. **SingleInstance** -> create a separate task containing only that activity
When navigating from XtreamHomeActivity to PlayerActivity, PlayerActivity (singleinstance)
runs in its own separate task.
finish() -> return to the previous task, which contains XtreamHomeActivity
DirectStireActivity is actually launched within the original task where XtreamHomeActivity resides
=> use singleInstance will create a instance in a separate task (just one)
=> open a another activity in this will move it to previous task
6. **Logcat** = a command-line tool; a component of Android SDK that allows developers to view system and application
logs => debugging, understand runtime behavior
7. @Test in JUnit:
    - mark a method as a test case
