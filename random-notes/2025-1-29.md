1. Dao: Interface, @Dao
AppDatabase: abstract class, @Database(entities = [SongTable::class], version = 1,      exportSchema = true) {
abtract function appDao: AppDao()
}
**exportSchema**: export the database schema into a folder; not mandatory, but it is a good practice to have version history of your schema in your codebase and you should commit the schema files into your version control system (but don't ship them with your app!).
2. UI = Ui elements + Ui state
UI state -> viewmodel as stateholder
3. MediaPlayer vs Media 3 Exo Player
    - **MediaPlayer**: easy; no streaming support;
        - Needs Foreground Service
        - Limited Format Support (MP3, AAC, OGG, etc.)
        - Speed & Pitch Control: Supported via PlaybackParams
        - Seek Performance:  Slower, depending on file type
    - **Media3 ExoPlayer**: more complex setup; streaming support;  Built-in queue management;
        - Audio Focus Handling with AudioAttributes
        - Background Playback with MediaSession;
        - Extensive Format Support (MP4, MKV, WebM, FLAC, etc.)
        - Speed & Pitch Control: Not natively supported (needs custom ExoPlayer)
        - Support crossfade & Gapless Playback
        - Custom Audio Processing (EQ, DSP): via AudioProcessors
        - Caching:  Supports disk/memory caching
        - Seek Performance:  Faster, optimized seeking
        - Android Auto / Wear OS / Bluetooth Support: via MediaSession

=> Media3: advanced features, streaming, playlists, or media session integration.
