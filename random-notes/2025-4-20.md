1. 5 Jetpack Compose Tricks That Saved Me Hours in Real Projects
	1. Dynamically Show TopAppBar Title Based on Scroll Using derivedStateOf
		val lazyListState = rememberLazyListState()
		val showTitle by remember {
    			derivedStateOf { lazyListState.firstVisibleItemIndex > 0 }
		}
	2. Apply Dynamic Theming with CompositionLocalProvider
		
	3. Preserve UI State Across Rotation with rememberSaveable
		
	4. Make Size Changes Feel Natural with animateContentSize()
		Whenever content size changes — like expanding a card, revealing extra text, or switching UI modes — sudden jumps can 
		feel jarring. Jetpack Compose offers a dead-simple solution: Modifier.animateContentSize().
	5. Add a Scroll-To-Top FAB That Appears When Needed

2. Performance metrics
	app startup
	smooth experience
	power saving
	smart data usage
	small app size
	crash free
3. Inspect -> Improve -> Monitor

4. AppStartup 
	Cold start -> Warm start -> Hot start
	Cold start:
		create process 
		Application#onCreate
	-> first time launch app, cache is empty -> longest phase
	Warm start:
		inflate view hierarchy
		Activity#onCreate
	-> when comeback from a background
	Hot Start: 
		Draw first frame
		Activity#onStart
	-> when go to foreground

	Time To Initial Display = TTID = default app startup end state = reported when first frame of your application is drawn
	When? -> first frame of application is drawn
	How to see? -> ActivityTaskManager: Displayed in logcat

	Time To Full Display = TTFD = optional metric that can use to further optimize your app startup time 
	When? -> data is loaded, user can start interacting
	How to see? -> ActivityTaskManager: Fully drawn

5. Smooth experience
	Behavior Jank = happens when an app is too busy to meet the frame timing window
	When? -> App is too busy doing work on the main thread and missing the timing window to draw a frame on screen 
	-> scrolling, content is moved on screen, ...

	Frame rate = the amount of redraws per second 
		default for android: 60fps
	Tip: Keeping as much work as possible off the main thread

	Always measure realease builds
		isShrinkResources = true
		isMinifyEnabled = true

	Measure performance twice or more
