Kotlin Delegation
	-> reuse functionality without inhetitance, keep my code DRY, extend class behavior without making it messy
	a class hands over some of its responsibilities to another class instead of implementing everything itself
	
	Kotlin provides two main types of delegation:
		Explicit Delegation (Manually delegating tasks) via DI
		Delegation by by Keyword (The smart way!) = delegate functions without writing botlerplate code
		-> dont need to manually forwarding function calls, we use the by keyword

	Exp: class LogManager(logger: Logger) : Logger by logger

	Why Use Delegation Here?
		We can easily switch between ConsoleLogger and FileLogger.
		No need to rewrite logging logic — just delegate it!
		Flexible and modular — new loggers can be added without changing LogManager.
	
	When Should You Use Delegation?
		You want to avoid inheritance but still reuse behaviour.
		You need multiple behaviours without a complex class hierarchy.
		You want better code organisation and flexibility.
		You want to follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) — keeping responsibilities separate.
		Keeps your classes lightwe ight
