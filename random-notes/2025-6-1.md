Question 1: Kotlin Smart Cast Limitations with Null Checks
	In Kotlin, under which condition does a smart cast not work after a null check?
	=> When the variable is declared as var and can be changed between check and use

	Kotlin uses smart casting to avoid redundant type checks or null assertions when the compiler can guarantee safety
	=> Use a val, so the compiler knows it canâ€™t change
	=> Use a local val inside the method
	=> if you must keep var, use a safe call with let to create a stable scope
=> Smart cast only work then the compiler can prove the value is stable (not mutable)
=> To safely rely on smart casts, make sure the variable is immutable (val) and not potentially modified between the check and the usage. 
=> If you must use var, consider safe access patterns like ?.let { ... } to create a scoped, non-null reference.

Question 2: Removing Sensitive Data from Git History
	If you commit sensitive data like API keys or credentials, simply deleting the file or reverting the commit is not enough. 
	That data still exists in the Git history.

	=> git filter-branch or git filter-repo followed by a force push
