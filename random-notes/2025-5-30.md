Mastering Android XML: Selectors, Styles, Layer Lists, and Shapes
	1. Selectors
		define how elements should behave under different states (like focused, pressed, or enabled)
		-> managing colors and drawables for various UI components, such as buttons, text, and backgrounds.
		2 type: color selector, drawable selector

	2. Layer Lists
	-> stack multiple drawables on top of each other. This is useful when you want to combine different visual elements, such as an 
	image with a background.
	=> drawable stacking

	3. Shapes
	-> define the background of UI components, such as buttons, cards, or text fields.
	=> You can use shapes to add rounded corners, gradients, strokes, and more.

	4. Styles
	-> define a common look for your UI elements.
	=> applying consistent font sizes, colors, padding, etc., across multiple views.

5 Kotlin 2.0 features that every developers must know
	1. Enum entries:
	-> returns a pre-allocated, immutable list (EnumEntries<E>) of all enum constants. It's the recommended replacement for the older 
		values() function.
		Enum.values() allocates a new array every single time you call it => waste memory
		Enum.entries returns the same list instance each time, significantly reducing overhead.
	=> better performance and API consistency

	2. Guard Conditions in when: Flatten Your Logic
		The ability to add an if condition directly to a when branch
	=> Use guard conditions to make your when expressions more expressive and easier to follow by avoiding deep if-else nesting within 
		branches.

	3. K2 Compiler & Smarter Smart Casts
	=> Less boilerplate due to fewer explicit casts (as Type) and increased code safety because the compiler has a better 
		understanding of your types.
	
	4. Context Parameters = Context Receiver
