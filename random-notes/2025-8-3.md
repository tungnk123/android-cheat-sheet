Don’t Make Your ViewModels Do Everything — There’s a Better Way
	Hold and expose UI state
	Coordinate async actions
	Emit UI events
	Delegate logic to other layers

1. “ViewModels Aren’t God Objects”
	Keep your ViewModel lean.
	Offload responsibilities to use cases or repositories.
	ViewModel = UI state + events only.

2. “Don’t Underestimate ProGuard”
	ProGuard isn’t just about shrinking — it obfuscates and optimizes too.
	You must write rules for libraries like Gson, Retrofit, and Dagger/Hilt to prevent runtime issues.
	Always test release builds with minifyEnabled = true.

3. “Jetpack Compose Isn’t Magic — Learn the Fundamentals”
	Recomposition rules, remember, derivedStateOf, and side-effect APIs (LaunchedEffect, rememberUpdatedState) are crucial.
	State hoisting is not just a pattern — it’s a necessity for clean Compose architecture.
	Compose previews are great, but not a substitute for real device testing.

4. “Testing Is a Superpower, Not a Burden”
	Start small with unit tests — especially for ViewModels and use cases.
	Use libraries like Turbine to test Kotlin Flows.
	Jetpack Compose has excellent testing support using composeTestRule and semantics.

5. “Build Gradle Is More Than a File — It’s a Tool”
	Understanding Gradle’s plugin lifecycle helps when debugging builds.
	Features like buildSrc, custom tasks, and version catalogs make your build maintainable at scale.
	Learn the difference between implementation and api.

6. “Overengineering Is Real ”
	Use clean architecture only when it fits your problem.
	Avoid premature abstraction. Code should evolve — not start fully “enterprisey.”
	Write the dumb version first — refactor later.

7. “Learn Kotlin Deeply”
	sealed classes + when = awesome for UI state.
	Use Flow and StateFlow for reactive streams.
	Learn extension functions, apply, let, run, and with properly.
