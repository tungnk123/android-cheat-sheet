DNS performance:
	1. FlashStart
	2. 1.1.1.1
	3. Lineguard by Secure64
	4. Google
	5. DNSFilter

	Cloudflare often offers the best performance, with Quad9 being strong on privacy/security.
	Combining a fast international resolver (like 1.1.1.1) with a local ISP DNS fallback seems to offer the best balance of 
		speed, reliability, and security for users.
	
	=> Cloudfare (1111) -> Local DNS -> Quad9, Google

Enhanced DNS:
	VPN / firewall / ad-blocker / parental control / DNS filter
	Privacy browsers / in-app private browsers
	Secure comms & wallets (encrypted messengers, crypto wallets, password managers)
	Apps likely to be censored/poisoned by ISPs (news, communities, utilities)
	Enterprise/IT apps (ZTNA/SASE/MDM, intranet)

	Fintech / telehealth / ride-hailing & delivery with strict availability SLOs.
	Realtime game / chat / calls

Android Test:
	Step 1: Setting Up the Foundation (The CI/CD Brain)
		Use github action
		Triggered automatically on every pull request
		Parallel test execution across multiple devices
		Zero human intervention required

	Step 2: Choosing the Right Testing Framework (My Secret Weapon)
		Espresso + UI Automator
		Espresso handles in-app interactions beautifully
		UI Automator manages system-level testing like notifications and permissions.
		Maestro â€” Complex user flow testing
