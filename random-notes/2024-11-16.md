1. **Enhance Koltin performance:** 
    - Minimize object creation
    - Each object creation involves memory allocation and overhead
    => **using primitives, immutable data structures, builder patterns**
        - Memory allocation = Every object creation requires the JVM to find available memory,
        potentially triggering garbage collection (which can pause execution).
        - Object Initialization: Objects undergo construction and initialization processes,
        involving method calls and property assignments.
        => employ `Builder` patterns for complex objects
        - Avoid object creation in Hot Paths (Frequently executed code sections): **cache, reusing objects**
    - Choose proper data structures
    	Prefer Arrays over Lists when working with primitive types.
    	Exp: `intArrayOf`
    - Utilize `apply` for initialization
    - Leverage Kotlin collections effectively: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
2. Sqlite vs Sql
    - Sqlite = a database engine;  embedded in the application
    - SQL = language to manage databases; used with a variety of databases
    - SQLite has limited concurrency vs  SQL in server-based databases supports higher concurrency and parallel transactions
    - SQL is used with scalable RDBMS
    - SQLite is suited for smaller, local applications with less data
