1. High-level classes shouldn’t depend on low-level classes. Both should depend on abstractions. 
Abstractions shouldn’t depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

2. 12 tips to mastering Kotlin Coroutines
	- Always Use Structured Concurrency: viewModelScope, lifecycleScope
	- Prefer withContext Over async for Single Operations
	- Use async Only for Parallel Tasks: use async and await	
		use withContext instead of async-await
		
	- Never Use GlobalScope
	- Switch Dispatchers Wisely
	- Handle Exceptions Gracefully: Use try/catch or a CoroutineExceptionHandler
	- Cancel Coroutines Properly: job.cancel(); ensureActive()
	- Use SupervisorJob for Independent Child Coroutines
	- Test Coroutines with runTest
	- Debounce User Input with Flows
	- Avoid Blocking Calls: Replace Thread.sleep() with delay()
	- Use coroutineScope for Scoped Parallelism

3. withContext vs async-await vs launch
	launch: 
		
	withContext: 
		best for single long-running operation
		Automatically propagates cancellation
		Simple and readable
	async-await: 
		best for parallel execution of independent tasks
		Requires explicit handling to ensure cancellation
		Slighty complex due to .await()
=> withContext: single background operation; cleaner, synchronous code; automatic cancellation propagation
=> async-await: multiple tasks that can run in parallel, improve performance by running tasks concurrently, handle overhead
	of managing cancellation and awaiting results

4. finish() vs finishAffinity()
