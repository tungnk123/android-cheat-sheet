In a typical MVVM architecture, what is a potential risk of exposing the ViewModel’s internal MutableLiveData to the View layer?
	-> It allows external modification of the ViewModel’s state, potentially leading to inconsistent UI behavior

	If the View layer (Activity or Fragment) has access to MutableLiveData, it can unintentionally or incorrectly update the state 
	managed by the ViewModel.

	=> This breaks encapsulation and can lead to UI inconsistencies, unexpected behavior, or bugs that are hard to trace.\

	=> The correct approach is to keep MutableLiveData private in the ViewModel and expose it as immutable LiveData to the View.

=> To maintain clean architecture and predictable state, always expose LiveData to the View layer and keep MutableLiveData private inside 
the ViewModel. This ensures one-way data flow and reduces the risk of inconsistent or invalid state updates.

In an Android MVVM architecture, what is the best way to automatically cancel a coroutine when the user leaves the screen?
	Use viewModelScope which cancels when ViewModel is cleared
	=> ensures coroutines do not outlive the ViewModel, preventing memory leaks and unnecessary background work.

Kotlin null check for multiple nullable var's
	=> smart cast not work with var even if you check null
	1. Nested let: ?let ?let
	2. Use local variable
		=> performance overhead

	3. change variable to immutable
	4. Pair with take if
	5. elvis operator with return (GUARD CLAUSE\)
		val a = a ?: return
	6. lateinit + isInitialized

-> still not good like guard in Swift
