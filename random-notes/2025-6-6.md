Kotlin: 5 Underrated Features to Make Your Code Shorter
	1. Type Aliases: Naming Complex Type Signatures
	=> long, complex generic types or function types.

	2. Delegated Properties: Say Goodbye to Getter/Setter Boilerplate
	=> Delegation in Kotlin allows you to pass the responsibility of a property's getter (and optionally setter) logic to a 
	separate helper object.

	3. Sealed Classes: Enums for State Management
	=>  represent restricted class hierarchies, perfect for modeling states where a value can be one of a limited set of types
	=> type safety, exhautiveness (when clause) and readability

	4. The invoke Convention: Making Objects Callable
	=> By providing an operator fun invoke(...) function, instances of your class can be called as if they were functions.
	=> Conciseness & Fluency, DSL Creation, Functional Style (Objects can act more like functions)

	5. Standard Library Functions: chunked and windowed
	-> hunked() splits a collection into lists of a specified size. 
	-> windowed() creates a sliding window over a collection.
	
	list.windowed(size, step = 1, partialWindows = false)

The Hidden Architecture Mistakes Killing Android Performance
	ViewModels should orchestrate, not own logic.
	Avoid LiveData-based navigation — delegate to the UI.
	Use screen-specific states for clarity and maintainability.
	Android APIs are okay — just isolate them properly.


Decorator vs Visitor Pattern:
	Visitor:
		Add new operations to existing object structure without modifying it
		Externalize operations from the object structure
		You need to perform different unrelated operations on an object structure
	Decorator: 
		Add behavior to individual objects dynamically
		Wrap objects to extend behavior
		You want to add/remove behavior at runtime without subclassing
=> Visitor: You need to run multiple unrelated operations on a fixed set of classes (e.g., tax calculations, UI rendering).
=> Decorator: You want to add optional features to an object (e.g., adding scrollbars or shadows to UI widgets).
