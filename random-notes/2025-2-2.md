1. The caught exception is too generic. Prefer catching specific exceptions to the case that is currently handled.
2. **Singleton with Hilt**
    - You DO NOT need to add MediaStoreExposer to a module or use @Provides because you are already using @Inject constructor
    - NO NEED to add a @Module because @Inject constructor already does the job.

**=> You only need a module if the class does not support @Inject constructor (e.g., an external class) or if you need to bind an interface**

3. @Inject constructor tells Hilt how to create an instance
4. Creating a Singleton in Hilt: 2 ways
    - **Using @Singleton with @Inject constructor (RECOMMENDED)**: easy
    - **Using @Module and @Provides**: If the class does not support @Inject constructor; interface implementation; passing configutation parameter
5. Object vs @Singleton + @Inject constructor:
    - Object: **pure utility class** (no dependencies, no need for lifecycle management
    - @Singleton + @Inject constructor: Can **inject dependencies** using Hilt, **Lifecycle-managed singleton**.
