1. LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order when iterating over its entries.
2. Factory Functions: mapOf, mutableMapOf, listOf, mutableListOf
-> create object without using 'new' keyword
3. list.assiociate {key to value} -> create a map from a list
4. @InstallIn(ServiceComponent::class) -> A Hilt component that has the lifetime of the service.
5. @Query("SELECT * FROM songs")
suspend fun entriesPathMapped(): Map<@MapColumn("path") String, Song>
=> @MapColumn -> Declares which column is used to build a map or multimap return value in a Dao query method.
6. 2 music retrieval methods
    - using MediaStore: retrieve music from Android's MediaStore (a system database for media files)
    - scanning the file system (MediaExposer): Scans device folders manually to find music files.
7. Using MediaStore:
    - Queries MediaStore, which stores indexed metadata of media files
    - Faster, since MediaStore maintains an indexed database
    - Accuracy depends on MediaStore’s database; may not include newly added files
    - Custom Folder Selection: ❌ Cannot select specific folders (only indexed ones)
    - Retrieves metadata (title, artist, album) directly from MediaStore
    - Duplicate Handling: Automatically managed by MediaStore
    - Not support .lrc files, .m3u files
8. File System Scan:
    - Manually scans device storage to find music files
    - Slower, as it manually reads directories and files
    - Accuracy: more accurate, as it scans all folders directly
    - Uses file extensions and MIME types to identify songs
    - Allows scanning specific folders chosen by the user
    - Needs to extract metadata manually from files (e.g., using ExoPlayer, FFmpeg)
    - Needs manual filtering to remove duplicate files

=> **MediaStore**: quick and efficient access; don’t need folder selection or custom file management; reliable metadata handling
=> **FileSystemScan**: full control over which folders to scan; want to include .lrc lyrics, playlists, and non-indexed music files; building an advanced music manager rather than a simple music player

9. **Fuzzy Search vs Normal Search**:
    - **Normal Search**:
        - exact match of character
        - Faster since it directly checks for string presence.
    - **Fuzzy Search:**
        - **Handles typos, misspellings, and similar words**
        - Finds relevant results even if input is incorrect
        - Slower due to complex similarity calculations
    
    => Fuzzy Search for Search Engines, Auto Complete Suggestions, Recommended System
    => **human-friendly, typo-tolerant results**
