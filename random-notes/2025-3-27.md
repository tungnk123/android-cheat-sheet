A CoroutineScope keeps track of any coroutine you create using launch or async
	
When creating a CoroutineScope it takes a CoroutineContext as a parameter to its constructor

Job = A Job is a handle to a coroutine. For every coroutine that you create (by launch or async), it returns a Job instance that 
	uniquely identifies the coroutine and manages its lifecycle

The CoroutineContext is a set of elements that define the behavior of a coroutine. It’s made of:
	Job — controls the lifecycle of the coroutine.
	CoroutineDispatcher — dispatches work to the appropriate thread.
	CoroutineName — name of the coroutine, useful for debugging.
	CoroutineExceptionHandler — handles uncaught exceptions, will be covered in Part 3 of the series.

Since a CoroutineScope can create coroutines and you can create more coroutines inside a coroutine, an implicit task 
	hierarchy is created

Job lifecycle
	New, Active, Completing, Completed, Cancelling and Cancelled
	While we don’t have access to the states themselves, we can access properties of a Job: isActive, isCancelled and 
		isCompleted
