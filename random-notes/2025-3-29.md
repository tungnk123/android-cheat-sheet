yield() suspends the coroutine and allows other coroutines to run.

yield vs isActive vs ensureActive
	yield:
		Suspends the coroutine, allowing other coroutines to run.
		When you have a long-running task and want to give other coroutines a chance to execute.
	isActive: 
		Checks whether the coroutine is still active.
		It does not suspend the coroutine but allows manual cancellation checks.
		When you need to periodically check for cancellation in a tight loop.
	ensureActive:
		Throws CancellationException if the coroutine is cancelled
		Immediately stops execution by throwing an exception.
		Ensuring that a coroutine stops execution ASAP if cancelled

	=> isActive: do something before end; Use when cleanup is required after stopping; execute task after the loop
	=> ensureActive: stop ASAP, dont do anything more; throw Exceptions
Cancellation Exception
	Cancellation of Coroutine code needs to be cooperative
	How to implement Cooperative cancellation: 
		job.isActive: do an action before finishing the coroutine
		job.ensureActive(): call isActive under the hood
		-> instantaneously stop work
		yield(): use when have CPU heavy computation that may exhaust thread-pool
		delay(): also have cancellation mechanism

	If you create your own suspend functions, make them cancellable
