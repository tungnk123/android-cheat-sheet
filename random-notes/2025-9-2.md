Major components of the Android platform:
	Application (System Apps): Home, Contacts, Phone, Browser, Camera, Calendar, Clock
	Application Framework: ActivityManager, WindowManager, ContentProviders, ViewSystem, ResourceManager, LocationManager
	Native C/C++ Libs: SQLite, OpenGL, Webkit, libs, SSL, ...
	Runtime: Dalvik + ART, Zygote
	HAL = Hardware Abstraction Layer: Audio, Bluetooth, Camera, Sensors, 
	Linux Kernel: driver, hardware: camera, mic, flash, disk, audio, bluetooth, wifi, power management, Thread management

Dalvik, JIT, AOT, and ART
	JIT (Just-In-Time): Compile bytecode → machine code at runtime.
	AOT (Ahead-Of-Time): Compile bytecode → machine code before runtime (usually at install).
	Dalvik: Android’s old runtime using JIT only.
	ART (Android Runtime): New runtime using a mix of JIT + AOT.
