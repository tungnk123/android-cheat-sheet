1. Declaring the value as a compile-time constant using the const keyword
=> avoid any method call
2. Prefer storing public global constants in their own object rather than a companion object
3. Local functions = functions that are declared inside other functions, using the regular syntax	
they are able to access the scope of the outer function
4. Null Safety:
    - makes a clear distinction between nullable and non-null types -> prevent unexpected NullPointerExceptions at runtime
    - a nullable type is always a reference type
    - Declaring a variable for a primitive type as nullable prevents Kotlin from using the Java primitive value types like int or float and instead the boxed reference types like Integer or Float will be used, involving the extra cost of boxing and unboxing operations
    
    => Use non-null primitive types whenever possible for more readable code and better performance
    
5. Array: 3 types (primitive, non-null object references, nullable object references)
IntArray, FloatArray and others: an array of primitive values. Compiles to int[], float[] and others
Array<T>: a typed array of non-null object references. This involves boxing for primitive types
Array<T?>: a typed array of nullable object references. This also involves boxing for primitive types, obviously

=> refer using IntArray than Array<Int> for example, to avoid boxing

6. Varargs = variable number of arguments
vararg argument actually gets compiled to an array argument of the given type
=> adds the cost of creating a new temporary array (even when using values from an existing array)
=> adding a method with an actual array argument instead of vararg for better performance code
7. runCatching {}
-> return try { Result.success(block()) } catch (e: Throwable) { Result.failure(e)}
8. ImageLoaderFactory in Coil:
    - A factory that creates new ImageLoader instances
    - ImageLoader = A service class that loads images by executing ImageRequests. Image loaders handle caching, data fetching, image decoding, request management, memory management, and more.
