1. Depedendency Inversion
Inversion of traditional dependency directions: high-level module depend on low-level module
high-level and low-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations
=>  reverses the conventional dependency direction
2. coding principle
- DRY = Dont Repeat Yourself -> avoid duplication code
+ How? -> extract commonly repeated code into method; using classes and inheritance; use interface
- KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid -> prioritize straightforward solutions over complex ones
-> enhance comprehensibility, usability, and maintainability
Apply to UI, architectture
+ How? -> use clear and descriptive variable and method names; Avoid unnecessary complexity by eliminating duplicated code
;separating responsibilities within our classes
- YAGNI = You ain't Gonna Need it = implement functionality only when it is truly necessary
	=> minimalist approach -> optimize development time, reduce complexity, and increase
	flexibility
 + How? -> prioritize features based on their necessity; Focus on delivering the core functional
