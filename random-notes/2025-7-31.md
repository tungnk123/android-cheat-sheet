Multithreading
	letting your program do multiple tasks at the same time using multiple threads
	A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a process

	Race condition: for not atomic variable
		two thread maniplate same variable
		Two or more threads access and modify shared data at the same time, causing unpredictable results.
		Program produces wrong or inconsistent output.
	
	Deadlock:
		Two or more threads are stuck waiting for each other’s resources, causing the program to freeze.
		Circular waiting for resources (e.g., thread A holds lock 1 and waits for lock 2, while thread B holds lock 2 and waits for 
			lock 1).
		Locks, semaphores, mutexes.
		Program freezes or hangs indefinitely.

	=> Race Condition = Data conflict due to no proper synchronization → incorrect results.
	=> Deadlock = Threads are waiting on each other forever → app freezes.

	Mutex = Mutual Exclusion.
	It’s a lock that ensures only one thread can access a piece of code or data at a time.

	How it works:
		Before changing shared data, a thread acquires a lock.
		Once done, it releases the lock.
		If another thread tries to enter while the lock is held — it waits


	Keep critical sections small
		Lock only what’s needed
