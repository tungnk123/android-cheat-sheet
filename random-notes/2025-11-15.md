1. Differences between Service, IntentService and Foreground service
	- **Service**: Looks like service run on background but NOT on UIthread unless you force it to. Can be killed.
	- **IntentService**: Deprecated. Intent Service which handles the intent in a background thread and kills itself.
	- **Foreground Service**: Starts persistent notification, less prone to killing. Used for essential tasks (audio playback, navigation tracking).
	- **Practical Context**: " If I'm downloading big files, I want to use Foreground Service Instead, for API calls that would return a couple of seconds I'd rather use a Coroutine in ViewModel.
2. Memory leaks
	- Inner classes that capture unintentional reference to Activity
	- Static references to Context
	- Listeners not unregistered (onDestroy)
	- Coroutines not cancelled
3. App Startup and Cold vs Warm Start Times
	- **Cold start**: App killed, kill all processes killed here (init, onCreate, layouts inflate) Slowest.
	- **Warm start:** App backgrounded but process still alive, just resume Fast.
