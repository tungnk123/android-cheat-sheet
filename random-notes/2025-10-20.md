Walmart Android Developer Interview Experience
	Given a string with '(', ')', and '*', check if it’s valid.	
		Maintain two counters — minOpen and maxOpen.
		For '(': increment both.
		For ')': decrement both.
		For '*': decrement minOpen (treating as )) but increment maxOpen (treating as ().
		If maxOpen < 0 at any point → invalid.
		At the end, if minOpen == 0 → valid.
	Max Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements -> This is the House Robber problem

	Implement LRU Cache
		Use a HashMap for quick key lookup.
		Use a Doubly Linked List to maintain usage order.

	Design Push Notification System for Walmart.
		FCM as push service.
		User-Device Mapping in DB.
		Kafka for queuing notifications.
		Retry logic for failures.
		Personalization via user preferences.

	He used the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure answers.
	

What happens if you don’t unregister a BroadcastReceiver?
-> He answered: It leads to a memory leak, because the receiver holds a reference to the context.

How is WorkManager different from JobScheduler?	
-> He explained WorkManager is more modern, supports constraints (like network type, battery), and works even after app restarts.

LRU Cache implementation
-> They expected him to design it with LinkedHashMap or a custom Doubly Linked List + HashMap combo.

High cohesion vs low coupling:
	cohesion = how well the parts of a module are related and focused on doing one specific job
	-> elements inside a module work closely an share a common purpose
	
	coupling = how different parts of a program depend on each other
	-> low coupling = the parts are more independent -> easier to change

Pullup vs PushDown rafactorings:
	Pull-up: move the same functions in child class to base class
	-> eliminate redundanct code, prevent inconsistencies
	
	Push-down: move the specific function to child class
	-> simplify the class hierachy and improve code orgainization
