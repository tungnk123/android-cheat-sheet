1. Concurrency vs Parallelism

2. 5 Hidden Secrets of Kotlin Coroutines
	CoroutineScope vs. SupervisorScope
		CoroutineScope:  If any child coroutine fails, the entire scope is cancelled, which means all other 
		children are cancelled as well
		SupervisorScope: A failure in one child coroutine does not affect its siblings; they continue running 
		independently
	Structured Concurrency is Your Best Friend:
		CoroutineScope, viewModelScope, or lifecycleScope
	Choose the Right Dispatcher: 
		Use Dispatchers.Main for UI updates.
		Use Dispatchers.IO for network or disk I/O.
		Use Dispatchers.Default for CPU-intensive work.
	Gracefully Exception Handling:
		try/catch + CoroutineExceptionHandler
	Embrace Cancellation and Timeouts:
		Coroutines are cancellable, which means you can gracefully stop them when they're no longer needed. 
		This is crucial for avoiding memory leaks and wasted resources
	=> Use withTimeout or withTimeoutOrNull to automatically cancel a coroutine after a specified duration

3. supervisorScope vs supervisorJob
	supervisorScope = A coroutine scope that automatically creates a SupervisorJob. It ensures that exceptions in child 
		coroutines donâ€™t cancel the entire scope
	supervisorJob =  A special type of Job in Kotlin Coroutines that allows child coroutines to fail independently 
		without canceling the entire parent scope

3. join vs joinAll vs awaitAll
	join:
		Used to wait for a single coroutine to complete
		It is a suspending function and does not return a result
	joinAll:
		Used to wait for multiple coroutines (Jobs) to complete.
		It is a convenience function for calling join() on multiple jobs.
	awaitAll: 
		Used for waiting for multiple Deferred tasks and collecting their results.
		Similar to joinAll(), but works with Deferred, which can return values.
=> Use join() and joinAll() for Jobs, and use await() and awaitAll() for Deferred when you need results.

5. Bridge pattern:
	Abstraction:
		The "abstraction" defines the interface for the "control" part of the two class hierarchies. 
		It maintains a reference to an object of the "implementation" hierarchy and delegates all of the real work 
		to this object.
	Implementation: 
		The "implementation" interface declares methods common to all concrete implementation classes. 
		It doesn't have to match the abstraction's interface. In fact, the two interfaces can be entirely different. 
		Typically the implementation interface provides only primitive operations, while the abstraction defines 
			higher-level operations based on those primitives.

	Usecase:
		Use the Bridge pattern when you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants 
		of some functionality
		Use the pattern when you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions
		Use the Bridge if you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.

=> Identify the orthogonal dimensions in your classes. These independent concepts could be: abstraction/platform, 
	domain/infrastructure, front-end/back-end, or interface/implementation.

6. constructor injection vs setter injection (property injection)
