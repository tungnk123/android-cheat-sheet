1. ('a'..'z').all { input.contains(it, ignoreCase = true) }
2. single expression function
3. How do you communicate between fragments
    - Using a Shared ViewModel: The most modern and recommended approach
    => works well with the Android Architecture Components and ensures data consistency even through configuration changes
    - Direct Interface Callback:
    Define an interface in the fragment and let the activity implement it. Fragment A can then
    call methods on this interface, which the activity handles by passing data to Fragment B
    - Fragment Result API:
    Fragment A sets a result with a unique key, and Fragment B registers to observe this
    result using that key
    - Passing Data through Arguments: pass data through Bundle arguments using Fragment.setArguments()
