1. atomic commits
2. ffmpeg
3. use semantic commit messages
4. LifecycleOwner:
    - an interface that represents an entity with an Android lifecycle
    - It is a component that has a defined lifecycle, such as an Activity or Fragment
    => allows it to hold and observe other components that are aware of its lifecycle state (like LiveData or ViewModel)
5. Dialog(
onDismissRequest = onDismissRequest,
properties = DialogProperties(
usePlatformDefaultWidth = false,
dismissOnBackPress = false,
dismissOnClickOutside = false
)
)
=> allow dialog cannot touch outside to dismiss
6. AtomicReference = manage reference to object safely in a multiple thread environment
use a Job to cancel something in ViewModel
7. val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
val elapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime
if (elapsedTime < minDuration) {do something}
8. jpg vs jpeg
    - jpg: for older systems
    - jpeg: for mordern os support longer file extensions
9. Data class
    - normal property:
    stored as a fixed value in memory
    value is stored directly as part of the object
    need explicit assignment to update
    contribute to copy, hashcode
    - computed property:
    its value is calculated dynamically based on other properties
    No dedicated storage in the object
    Recalculates every time it's accessed
    => computed property dont contribute to the auto-generated copy, hashcode and toString method in data class
10. ImageMagick vs FFmpeg
    - edit and manipulating digital images
