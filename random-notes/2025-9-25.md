Parallesism in Coroutine vs Threads
	Coroutine:
		Coroutines don’t inherently provide parallelism, as they often run within a single thread. 
		-> pseusdo parallelism: interleaving the execution of multiple tasks
	Thread:
		true parallelism when executed on multi-core processors
		-> suitable for CPU-bound tasks that can be divided into parallel subtasks

Android — Jetpack — Lifecycle-Framework
	An object is said to be lifecycle-aware if it is able to detect and respond to changes in the lifecycle state of other objects 
		within an app.

	It is also possible to configure any class to be lifecycle-aware by implementing the LifecycleObserver interface within the class.

	Lifecycle Owner refers to any class that has an associated lifecycle, such as activities and fragments.

	The concept of a Lifecycle Owner is central to the Lifecycle framework, which allows the Lifecycle Observer to monitor and react 
		to changes in the lifecycle states of these components.

	A Lifecycle Observer observes and reacts to various lifecycle events of a component, such as an activity or fragment.

	Lifecycle States:
		Lifecycle.State.INITIALIZED
		Lifecycle.State.CREATED
		Lifecycle.State.STARTED
		Lifecycle.State.RESUMED
		Lifecycle.State.DESTROYED

	Lifecycle Events:
		Lifecycle.Event.ON_CREATE
		Lifecycle.Event.ON_START
		Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME
		Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE
		Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP
		Lifecycle.Event.ON_DESTROY
		Lifecycle.Event.ON_ANY

	In order for a lifecycle-aware component to observe the state of a lifecycle owner it must implement the LifecycleObserver 
	interface and contain event listener handlers for any lifecycle change events it needs to observe.


ignoreUnknownKeys = true
	Ignore any extra fields in the JSON that are not in your Kotlin data model
	Prevents crashes if server sends new/extra fields
coerceInputValues = true
	If JSON has invalid values (e.g., enum not recognized, number out of range), they are replaced with default values instead of 
		throwing an error
	Makes parsing more tolerant
explicitNulls = false
	JSON null values will be skipped instead of setting the property to null explicitly
	Keeps default values if null is received
isLenient = true
	Accepts non-standard JSON (e.g., comments, unquoted keys, single quotes, etc.)
	Loosens strict JSON rules

=> 	ignoreUnknownKeys → tolerate extra JSON keys
 	coerceInputValues → tolerate bad values
 	explicitNulls → control how nulls are treated
 	isLenient → tolerate non-standard JSON syntax
