Function reference:
	:: -> produce a value object that implements a function type
	
	all callable references share the super-type KCallable<R>

	Type of function references:
		top-level; unbound member; bound member; extension; constructor
		property getter; property bound getter; property setter

	Bound vs Unbound:
		val unbound = List<*>::isEmpty // (List<*>) -> Boolean
		val bound = listOf(1, 2)::isEmpty // () -> Boolean

	=> Unbound references need the receiver as their first parameter, bound ones already carry a receiver
=> :: turns any callable into a first-class value that you can store, pass and invoke
=> These are function, 

callbackFlow { … } creates a cold Flow. The builder block runs every time you call a terminal operator such as collect.
	A flow produced with callbackFlow is effectively “single-subscriber” unless you explicitly make it hot.
	
	Why this pattern breaks when the upstream is a single hardware resource
	With the microphone (or any other exclusive resource) each new collection:
		Calls your callbackFlow { … }.
		Tries to start a second AudioRecord (or attaches a second callback to the same one).
	=> Few audio drivers tolerate that, so one of the pipelines stalls or the recorder throws—which is why, in your real app, analysis 
stopped after you changed the preference.

Single-handle sources that break with two concurrent collects
 	CameraX preview – second collect re-binds the camera, first preview freezes → shareIn and bind once.
 	Bluetooth LE scan – second startScan cancels the first, only latest collector gets results → scan once, multicast via shareIn/stateIn.
 	GPS location updates – duplicate listeners waste battery; one may stop silently → register one listener, hot-flow the data.
 	WebSocket – two sockets to the same URL; server may drop one or you double bandwidth → keep one socket open, broadcast frames.
 	Serial/USB device – device file allows one reader; second open fails (“resource busy”) → open once, push bytes into a MutableSharedFlow.

Jetpack compose is a declarative UI framework

Koin vs Hilt 
	Hilt:
		Moderate to complex. Requires annotations and integration with Android lifecycle.
		Compile-time DI (Dagger-based). Catches errors early.
		Faster at runtime, but longer build times.
		Steeper learning curve. More powerful.
		Better for large/complex projects.
		Backed by Google. Strong support.
		Learning curve: Steep. Requires understanding scopes, components.
	Koin:
		Simple. No annotations or code generation. Kotlin DSL-based.
		Runtime DI. Easier but with slight performance overhead.
		Slower at runtime, but quicker builds.
		Very easy to use. Great for beginners.
		Suitable for small to medium apps.
		Community-driven. Growing steadily.
		Learning curve: Flat. Minimal boilerplate.

	=> Use Hilt if: You need compile-time safety, large team, Android framework integration.
	=> Use Koin if: You want simplicity, fast setup, or building a smaller app.

Scoped Storage:
	introduced in Android 10 (API 29)
	limits how apps access files on external storage to improve user privacy and data security.

	1. App-Specific Storage
		Each app gets a private directory on external storage.
		Other apps cannot access this data.
	2. Restricted Shared Storage Access
		No direct access to shared media (photos, videos, etc.).
		Must use Android’s MediaStore API.
	3.MediaStore API
		Used to query and access shared media files (e.g., images, videos).
		Requires READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.
	4. Storage Access Framework (SAF)
		For accessing specific files outside app’s sandbox.
		Allows user-approved file access via file picker.
	
		val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT)
		intent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_OPENABLE)
		intent.type = "*/*"
		startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_PICK_FILE)
	5. Permissions
		Apps must request specific permissions (e.g., READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE).
		SAF grants fine-grained file access with user consent.
	6. Developer Impact
		Developers must update apps to use new APIs.
		Ensures compatibility while protecting user data.
=> Scoped Storage is a privacy-first storage model that requires devs to adapt how apps handle files—using proper APIs and user-granted 
	permissions.

ViewInflater vs Binding
	val view = LayoutInflater.from(context).inflate(R.layout.layout_pdf_report, root = null, attactToRoot = false)
	val binding = LayoutPdfReportBinding.inflate(LayoutInflater.from(this))

Sample tips in Kotlin Flow:
	Always sample once near the source if you are doing expensive work per item.
 	Add a second sample in the UI only to smooth rendering or battery load—feel free to drop it if service cadence is already slow enough.
 	Never oversample downstream expecting to “resurrect” detail that upstream already threw away; sampling only discards events.
