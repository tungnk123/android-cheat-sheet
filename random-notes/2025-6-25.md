viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch {
	viewLifecycleOwner.repeatOnLifeCycle(LifeCycle.State.STARTED)
}

viewLifecycleOwner => so powerful
	viewLifecyleOwner.repeatOnLifecycle -> safe to update binding
	lifecycle.repeatOnLifecycle -> not safe, could run after onDestroyView
-> memory leaks, null exceptions, waste resources
=> Best Practices: Always use viewLifecycleOwner.repeatOnLifeCycle()
  

Software Engineering Jargon Terms Every Senior Developer Should Know
	1. Loose Coupling / High Cohesion
		Components should be minimally dependent on each other (loose coupling), but internally consistent and focused (high cohesion).
	2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
		Split commands (write operations) from queries (read operations) for scalability and clarity.
	3. Event Sourcing
		Persist domain events instead of just the final state.
		-> Full audit trail, easy event replay, temporal debugging.
	4. Strangler Fig Pattern
		-> Gradually replace a legacy system by “strangling” it from the outside.
	5. Code Smell
		It may not be a bug, but something feels wrong in the codebase — a sign of future maintainability issues.
	6. Technical Debt
		Short-term tradeoffs in code quality that accumulate “interest” over time.
	7. Separation of Concerns (SoC)
		Each module should have a single, distinct responsibility.
	8. Fail Fast
		Errors should surface as early as possible to avoid downstream chaos.
		early return
	9. Race Condition
		Two or more threads access shared data in an unpredictable sequence.
	10. Immutable Infrastructure
		If it changes, rebuild it — don’t mutate it in place.
	11. Canary Release
		Gradually roll out a new version to a small subset of users before a full release.
	12. Test Pyramid = A testing strategy:
		Base: Many unit tests
		Middle: Fewer integration tests
		Top: Few UI/end-to-end tests
	13. Blue-Green Deployment
		Run two environments (blue & green); switch traffic to the new version when ready.
	14. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
		Manage infrastructure using code and automation tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible).
	15. Yak Shaving
		Doing a series of small tasks before completing the actual goal.
	16. Dogfooding
		Using your own product to test and improve it.
	17. Sharding
		Splitting a database into smaller, faster, more manageable parts (shards).
	18. Thundering Herd Problem
		Too many processes wake up or request something at once, overwhelming the system.
	19. Zero Trust
		Security model: never trust, always verify—regardless of network location.
	20. Smart Endpoints, Dumb Pipes
		Microservices should handle logic (smart), and communication channels (pipes) stay simple.
