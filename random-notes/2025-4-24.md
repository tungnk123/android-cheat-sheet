Kotlin DSL (Domain Specific Language) — That Made My Code Beautiful
	Kotlin DSL is a simpler way to talk to your code.
	Because it’s like creating your own little language using Kotlin
		Specific to one thing (e.g., building UI, writing Gradle scripts),
		Clear and easy to understand,
		Readable like a story or instruction list.
	fun address(block: AddressBuilder.() -> Unit) {
        	address = AddressBuilder().apply(block).build()
    	}

The 3 Rules That Changed Everything
	1. Talk Before You Code
	2. Write Ugly Code First
		After: "I'll brute-force this first, then optimize. Here's a simple O(n²) solution — we can improve later if needed."
	3. Ask Questions Like a Senior Dev
		Good: "Should we handle null inputs? Is performance critical here? Any memory constraints?

	=> It's about: ✅ Thinking aloud ✅ Prioritizing clarity over cleverness ✅ Treating the interview like a collaboration, 
		not an exam
