5 Hidden Android Libraries That Will Level Up Your App Development
	1. Sandwich — Effortless API Response Handling
		Sandwich abstracts all that into a clean and declarative API. You just call .onSuccess {} and .onError {} — 
		and it handles the rest.
		Standardized API response model
		Retry logic built-in
		Works perfectly with Retrofit, Ktor, and Coroutines
	2. Lottie for Android — Stunning Animations, Zero Effort
		Lottie renders Adobe After Effects animations exported as JSON files using the Bodymovin plugin. 
	3. Chucker — Your Built-In Postman for Debugging
		It captures all HTTP requests and responses inside your app so you can inspect headers, bodies, errors, and even share logs — 
		all without leaving the emulator or device.
	4. Coil — Fast, Kotlin-First Image Loading
		Coil is built for Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It's lighter than Glide, faster in many cases, and deeply integrates with the 
		Android ecosystem.
		Kotlin Coroutines support
		Compose-ready
		SVG loading support
		GIF support
		Low memory footprint
	5. Koin — Lightweight Dependency Injection Made Simple
		Koin uses Kotlin DSLs to make defining and injecting dependencies a breeze. 
		It's fast, easy to test, and great for modular projects.
