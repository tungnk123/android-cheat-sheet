You are given a legacy app with poor architecture and high technical debt. How do you refactor it?
	Start with small refactoring using SOLID principles.
	Introduce dependency injection and modularization gradually.
	Replace deprecated APIs and optimize database queries.

Your app is experiencing high ANR rates. What steps do you take to diagnose and fix it?
	Use Systrace and Perfetto to analyze main thread blocking.
	Optimize UI rendering and avoid long-running operations on the main thread.

A new requirement demands real-time data sync between the app and the backend. How do you approach it?
	Use WebSockets or Firebase Firestore for real-time updates.
	Implement offline caching with Room or WorkManager.

Explain how you would design an offline-first Android application.

	Use local storage (Room, SharedPreferences) and sync via WorkManager.
