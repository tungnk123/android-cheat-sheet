1. LifeCycle
onCreate(): view is first created -> create view, load data from bundle
onStart(): view is becoming visible to user
onResume(): user can be interacting with view -> top of back stack
onPause(): background, still vivisle
onStop(): no longer visible
onDestroy(): finish
2. OnCreate() vs onStart():
onCreate(): create only once during the activity lifecycle
onstart(): called when the activity becomes visible to user, typically after onCreate(), onRestart()
3. finish() in onCreate() -> onDestroy(), no onPause(), onStop()
setContentView() in onCreate() -> only once -> save performance
4. Click home button/ screen light off/ incoming call
=> onPause() -> onStop() => onRestart() -> onStart() -> onResume()
5. onSaveInstanceState() â€” is a method used to store data before pausing the activity to Bundle
OnRestoreInstanceState() - recover saved state from Bundle
both onCreate() and onRestoreInstanceState() callback methods receive the same bundle
called after the onStart()
