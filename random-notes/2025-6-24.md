Streams can emit three different things: a value (of some type), an error, or a "completed" signal

Observables are characterized by the following three aspects:
	Data Lifecycle: An observable is a primitive type that can contain zero or multiple values. These values are pushed over any duration, 
		determining the lifecycle of the stream.
	Cancellable: Observables can be cancelled at any time. By informing the producer that you no longer require updates, you can cancel a 
		subscription to an observable.
	Lazy Evaluation: Observables are lazy, meaning that they do not perform any actions until you subscribe to them. Similarly, they cease 
		operations when unsubscribed. This stands in contrast to Promises, which are eager and must be settled each time they are 
		invoked before further processing occurs.
