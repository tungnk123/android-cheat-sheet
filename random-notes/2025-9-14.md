companies treat employees as tools to complete tasks, rather than recognising and respecting them as humans.
no paycheck is worth trading health, family, and sanity.
Interview tips:
	1. You’re interviewing them too. Don’t forget — while they assess you, you should be assessing their culture.
	2. Red flags appear in small moments.
		Pay attention when they talk about working hours, deadlines, or “commitment.”
	3. Walking away is powerful.
		A job you get at the cost of your dignity is never a win.
	4. If a company shows you who they are during the interview, believe them.
=> Sometimes, walking out is the best answer.

Apple Rejected My App. Here is the Reason
	How swapping “Allow” for “Continue” saved my App Store submission.
	On iOS, developers are not allowed to influence the user’s choice when granting permissions.
	
	If your custom pre-permission screen also says “Allow,” you’re essentially nudging the user toward a “yes” before the real 
		choice even appears. Apple sees that as misleading — a dark pattern.

	The fix was simple:
		On iOS → use “Continue.”
		On Android → keep “Allow.”
	
	They want users to make decisions in the official dialog, free from developer influence. 
	That’s why they only accept neutral words like “Next” or “Continue.”
