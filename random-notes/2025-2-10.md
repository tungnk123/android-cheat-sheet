1. Myth 1: **Kotlin apps are bigger and slower than Java apps -> Wrong**
On the benefit side, the team achieved a 25% reduction in lines of code. Their code is cleaner, clearer,
and easier to maintain.
=> you can and should be using code shrinking tools, such as R8, which even has specific optimizations for Kotlin.
2. Myth 2: **Getters and setters are expensive -> Wrong**
It’s useful to hide the private data of your class, and you don’t need to expose it just for performance reasons.
Stick with getters and setters.
3. Myth 3: **Lambdas are slower than inner classes**
instead of writing inner classes go for lambda: it creates much more concise, cleaner code that your code reviewers
will love.
4. Fastlane:
    - CI/CD automation tool for mobile app development (iOS and Android)
    - Automate: Building the app, Running tests, Deploying to App Store / Google Play, Managing certificates and provisioning profiles, Distributing builds to TestFlight, Firebase, or other testing platforms,
    - Capture screenshots automatically
    => The easiest way to build and release mobile apps.
