The Android Developer's Dilemma: Why 73% Choose Retrofit Over Ktor (And When They Shouldn't)
	Retrofit: it's heavily tied to the Android/JVM ecosystem
	=> Not KMP

	Ktor: pure Kotlin networking that works everywhere. 
	No Java baggage, no Android assumptions — just clean, coroutines-first networking.

	Bundle size: Ktor client is lighter (~2MB vs Retrofit's ~3MB+ with dependencies)
	Startup time: Retrofit's reflection-heavy approach has a slight cold-start penalty
	Memory usage: Ktor's coroutines-first design uses memory more efficiently

	Retrofit Usecase:
		Your team is primarily Android-focused and multiplatform isn't on the roadmap
		You need extensive third-party integration (OkHttp interceptors, Moshi converters, etc.)
		Junior developers make up most of your team — Retrofit's annotations are more beginner-friendly
		Tight deadlines mean you can't afford to debug multiplatform networking quirks
	Ktor usecase: 
		Multiplatform development is part of your strategy (even if not immediate)
		Your team loves Kotlin and wants to avoid Java-legacy patterns
		You're building from scratch and don't need extensive third-party ecosystem support
		Performance optimization and memory efficiency are critical

Android git workflow:
	3 branch: main, develop, release
	name convention: feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/, experiment, ...

I Analysed the Top 100 Play Store Apps — Here’s What They All Have in Common
	Pattern #1: They All Solve One Problem (Really, Really Well)
		Solve one workflow bottleneck
		Fix one daily frustration
	=> 1 great value only

	Pattern #2: The "5-Second Rule" (And Why It Makes or Breaks Everything)
		Every top app delivered value within 5 seconds.
		Good onboaring screens

	Pattern #3: Simpplicity is king

	Pattern #4: The Update Paradox Top apps update frequently (every 2–3 weeks) but feel stable.

	Pattern #5: The Review Response Reality 87% of top apps respond to user reviews within 48 hours.
