Kotlin 2.4 Introduces Rich Errors
	Before:
		try-catch
		Result
		Arrow's Either
	After: 
		Rich Errors

	instead of throwing exceptions, functions can now return them as part of the type system
	fun fetchUser(): User | NetworkError
	=> 	type-safe by design
		no more boilerplate try-catch
		way easier to test

	Usecase:
		HTTP Requests:
			fun fetchUser(): User | AppError
		Input validation
			fun validateEmail(email: String): ValidEmail | EmailValidationError
		File operations
			fun readFile(path: String): FileContent | FileAccessError
		Auth flows
			fun login(credentials: Credentials): Session | AuthFailure

Kotlin’s Smart Casts: Unveiling the Magic of Type Inference
	write cleaner, more concise code by eliminating the need for excessive type checking
	How to use? -> use 'is'
	1. Understanding the Essence of Smart Casts
		Smart casts allow the Kotlin compiler to intelligently cast an object to a specific type when certain conditions are 
		satisfied
		These conditions include nullability checks and logical evaluations that assure the object’s type at a given point in 
		code execution.

	2. Safe Use of Nullable Types
		Smart casts also come into play when dealing with nullable types

	3. Combining with When Expressions
		when (value) {
        		is String -> do something
        		is Int -> do something
=> enhanced readability, reduced null risks, streamlined logic
