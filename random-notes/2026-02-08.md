1. 10 Kotlin Mistakes That Silently Destroy Android Performance
	- Chaining Collection Operations Inside Hot Paths
		- Creates a new intermediate collection
		- Allocates memory
		- Adds iteration cost
		- => asSequence()
	- Using `data class copy()` in Tight Loops
	- Launching Too Many Coroutines -> Use structured concurrency
	- Switching Dispatchers Excessively
	- Using Flow for Everything
		- If you just need a simple function call, use a function.
		- Flow when: multiple emissions, backpressure concerns, long-lived streams
	- Overusing Inline Classes and Generics Without Understanding Boxing
	- Profile before and after changes
2. **Avoid independent CoroutineScopes** inside the ViewModel.
	- It dont cancel when viewModel is cleared
