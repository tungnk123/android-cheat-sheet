1. Concurrency vs Paralelisim

3. By replacing traditional try-catch-finally blocks with runCatching, you can make your code more structured and predictable
	Use runCatching when you want your functions to always return a meaningful result instead of throwing exceptions
	Replace empty catch blocks with a more concise runCatching.
	Use getOrElse to provide default values in case of failure.
	Use getOrThrow when you need to rethrow exceptions while still keeping structured error handling.
	Handle multiple exception types using when inside recover, recoverCatching or onFailure.
	Utilize use to properly handle resource cleanup, replacing finally blocks effectively.
	If used within coroutines, ensure proper handling to avoid unintended suppression of cancellations.

3. Simplify Functional Composition with let
	Functional composition, that is, chaining simple functions into a more complex one
