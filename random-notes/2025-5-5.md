Top Interview Questions and Answers for Senior Android Developers
	Describe a complex app architecture you have implemented and why you chose it.
	-> MVVM -> in large-scale app to ensure seperation of concerns

	How do you manage dependencies in a large Android project?
	-> Hilt -> simplifies DI by providing lifecycle-aware components and reduces boilerplate code

	What strategies do you use to improve the performance of an Android application?
	-> Optimize layouts by reducing hierarchy depth.
	Use RecyclerView instead of ListView for efficient rendering.
	Leverage ProGuard or R8 for code shrinking.
	Avoid memory leaks by using WeakReferences and lifecycle-aware components.
	Perform background tasks using WorkManager or Coroutines.

	Explain the role of Coroutines and Flow in Kotlin for Android development.
	-> Coroutines: Simplify asynchronous programming by providing a sequential syntax for background tasks, avoiding callback hell.
	-> Flow: A reactive stream API that handles multiple asynchronous data streams and emits values over time.

	How do you approach testing in Android?
	-> Unit Testing: Use JUnit and Mockito for testing business logic.
	UI Testing: Leverage Espresso for automated UI tests.
	Integration Testing: Ensure seamless interaction between app components.
	End-to-End Testing: Test complete user workflows.

	Describe a time when you optimized an Android app for better scalability and maintainability.
	-> modular architecture -> parallel development, reduced build times

	How do you handle security concerns in Android applications?
	-> Use EncryptedSharedPreferences for sensitive data.
	Validate user inputs to prevent SQL Injection or XSS attacks.
	Enable HTTPS with SSL pinning for secure communication.
	Obfuscate code using R8 to protect against reverse engineering.

EncryptedSharedPreference vs DataStore:
	EncryptredSharedPreferences:
		keys & values encrypted using Jetpack Security
		XML file in internal storage
		Synchronous I/O (can block main thread)
		Slower for frequent or large writes
	DataStore:
		No built-in encryption (you must encrypt manually)
		Protocol Buffers (Typed) or Preferences (Key-Value)
		Fully asynchronous (uses Kotlin coroutines)
		Faster and more efficient for modern apps
=> Storing access tokens, API keys: EncryptedSharedPreferences
=> Storing user preferences/settings: DataStore
=> Need for encryption + async: Combine: EncryptedSharedPrefs + coroutines OR encrypt manually in DataStore (Cipher, MasterKey)
