Android interview questions:
	Use async only when you need parallel results. Don’t just wrap everything in it.
	
	LiveData — lifecycle-aware, old-school, mutable by default.
	Flow — cold stream, starts when collected, supports transformations (map, filter, etc.).
	StateFlow — hot stream, holds last value, great for UI state.

	lateinit is for vars, mutable and meant for dependency injection or views.
	lazy is for vals, immutable and thread-safe by default.
	
	Access lateinit before init -> You get a UninitializedPropertyAccessException — not a null pointer, but it still crashes your app.

	Delegate -> property delegate, class delegate
	=> lazy, observable, and custom delegates 

	Tail recursion optimizes recursive calls into loops using the tailrec keyword — avoiding stack overflow.\

15 Ways to Improve Android App Startup Time
	Google reveals that with every additional second of the loading time, the probability of drawings from users grows exponentially.

	1. Measure Before You Optimize
		What you cannot measure, you cannot rectify. Use:
		Android Studio Profiler
		Startup Tracing in Perfetto
		androidx.startup library
		=> Never start optimizing without a baseline your cold/warm start times

	2. R8 + ProGuard: Less App Size++
		Use R8 for code shrinking and resource optimization

	3. Lazy Initialization with App Startup
		Avoid initializing everything in Application.onCreate(). Use the App Startup library

	4. Use SplashScreen API
		We should use the native SplashScreen API (There is new API from Android 12, better in Android 15), not blocking main thread.

	5. Migrate to Jetpack Compose
		Traditional XML inflation is slow. Unlike Compose, it avoids layout inflation and directly renders UI Startup improvements

	6. Optimize Dependency Injection
		Use lazy injection with Hilt or Koin when possible!
	7. Keep Main Thread Clean
		Do the heavy lifting on background threads and move I/O away from the main thread.

	8. Avoid Overdraw in UI
		Detecting Overdraw using Layout Inspector

	9. Optimize Images
		Instead of PNG / JPEG use WebP or AVIF
		Enable VectorDrawable caching in Compose.

	10. Minimize ContentProviders
		Each ContentProvider adds startup overhead
		=> merge or postpone

	11. Preload Critical Data with WorkManager
		Preload critical data, before it is requested by the user

	12. Leverage Android 15 Features		
		Built on improvements to the ART runtime
		Background app pre-warming
	13. Apply Baseline Profiles
		
	14. Keep Services & Broadcasts Minimal
		Avoid auto-start services. Only use foreground services when needed.
	15. Test on Low-End Devices
