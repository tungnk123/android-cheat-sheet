My Job Interview Experience : Senior Android Developer Role
	"Can you describe the Android Activity Lifecycle and why understanding it is crucial?"
	-> manage resources effectively, preventing memory leaks, ensuring a smooth UX

	MVVM:
		Model = data + business logic
		View = the UI Activities, Fragments, Composables -> observes changes in ViewModel, send user actions to ViewModel
		ViewModel = bridge holds UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way survives the Configuration change

	"How do you handle background tasks in Android? What are the different options and when would you choose one over the other?"
		Coroutine with apprripriate Dispatcher:
			short-lived operations that dont need to survive process death 
			-> network, IO, file
		WorkManager:
			deferrable, guaranteed background work (with constraints) even if the app closes or the device restarts
			-> sync data periodically, uploading logs or applying filter to images in the background
		Service (Foreground/Background): 
			less common now with WorkManager
			Tasks need to be actively aware of by user
			-> music playback and ongoing navigation

	"Tell me about your experience with Jetpack Compose. What are its advantages and challenges?"
	-> Advantages: declarative UI, less boilerplate code, reusability
	-> Challenges: learning curve, hard to optimize performance
