1. Use `internal` modifier to limit their visibility to only inside the current module
Keep the number of top-level declarations to a minium
Prefer readability than additional fiew lines of code
Prefer creating a dedicated `data class` to using a `Pair` or `Triple`
Prefer `exhautive when` statements as using the else branch can result in bugs
=> dont use else in `enum`, `sealed class`, `sealed interface`
2. At the beginning of career => learn more than you need to earn
=> learning, pay, overall risk
At the end of our lives, we only have the stories that we can tell, and the wealthiest people have
the greatest stories
3. **effectiveness > efficiency**
**think -> plan -> act**
=> manage your time => prioritize
    
    ```jsx
    functional interface
    interface LambdaInterface {
    	fun doSomething(s)
    }
    ```
    
4. Refactoring code:
    - using one level of abstraction
    
    ```jsx
    
    override fun setUpViews() {
    	super.setUpViews()
    	setupRecyclerView()
    	setupViewPager()
    }
    rvLiveTv.setupRecyclerView(channelAdapter, { data ->
    	handleLiveStreamClick(data)
    })
    override fun setupObservers() {
    	super.setupObservers()
    	observe(xtreamHomeViewModel.vodStreams) { xtreamVods -> updateVodStreams(xtreamVods) }
    }
    ```
