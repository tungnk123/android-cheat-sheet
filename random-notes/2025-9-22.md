Chip vs Process vs Core
	CPU (Central Processing Unit)
		Historically meant a single processing unit.
		Today, when people say "CPU," they often mean the whole processor package (which can contain multiple cores).
	Core
		A single computing unit inside a CPU.
		Each core can run its own thread of instructions independently.
		Example: A quad-core CPU = one chip with 4 cores, so it can run 4 tasks in parallel.

	Chip
		The physical silicon piece manufactured by Intel, AMD, Apple, etc.
		A chip may contain:
		One CPU (with one or multiple cores).
		Extra components (cache, graphics unit, AI accelerator, etc.).

	Register (Hardware, inside CPU)
		Registers are the smallest, fastest storage inside a CPU core.
		Used to hold immediate data (numbers, memory addresses, flags) while instructions execute.

	Speed order: Register > Cache > RAM > Disk.

No ConcurrentHashSet in Java/Android: The JDK doesn’t provide a class with that name.
 	Workaround: Use Collections.newSetFromMap(new ConcurrentHashMap<>()) → gives you a thread-safe Set.
 	Alternatives:
 		CopyOnWriteArraySet: good for many reads, few writes.
 		ConcurrentSkipListSet: ordered, slower.
 => Best practice: For a fast, unordered concurrent set, use Collections.newSetFromMap(ConcurrentHashMap()).

Thread Safety in Android
	Race conditions — Multiple threads modifying shared data
	UI Thread — Only UI thread can update views
	Synchronization — Controlling access to shared resources
	Immutable objects — Naturally thread-safe

	=> @Synchronized, Atomic variables, or Use thread-safe collections (ConcurrentHashMap, ConcurrentLinkedQueue)
	Coroutine safety with proper dispatchers
	Immutable objects

Kotlin Source Code (.kt)
      ↓ kotlinc → JVM Bytecode (.class)
      ↓ D8/R8 → Dalvik Executable (.dex)
      ↓ Packaged into APK / AAB (contains .dex + resources)
      ↓ Upload to Google Play
      ↓ Downloaded & installed on device
      ↓ ART (Android Runtime) loads .dex into memory
      ↓ JIT (Just-In-Time) / AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compile to native ARM/ARM64
      ↓ CPU executes machine instructions
