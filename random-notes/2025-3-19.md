1. Adapter pattern:
	The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects.
	Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapterâ€™s methods.
	Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the 
		second object expects.

2. Dispatchers.Main.immediate vs Dispatchers.Main in Kotlin
	Dispatchers.Main.immediate also targets the main thread but with a twist
	It attempts immediate execution if the current thread is the main thread and not busy with a frame. 
	=> This leads to faster UI updates

	Dispatcher.Main: 
		predictable execution order
		when immediate execution isn't critical
		ensures that these updates happen sequentially and predictably
		Always schedules the coroutine to run on the main thread after the current main-thread execution finishes.
		If the coroutine is launched from the main thread, it is dispatched asynchronously, meaning it gets placed in 
		the event queue and executes after the current task completes.
	Dispatcher.Main.Immediate:
		when you need instant UI updates, like in animations or responding to user inputs
		If the coroutine is launched from the main thread, it runs immediately without being dispatched to the queue.
		If the coroutine is launched from a background thread, it behaves the same as Dispatchers.Main, scheduling 
		execution on the main thread asynchronously.

	=> Use Dispatchers.Main.immediate when you need to avoid unnecessary dispatching and execute immediately if 
	already on the main thread (e.g., updating UI elements with minimal delay).

=> Dispatchers.Main: Always queues the coroutine to run after the current main thread tasks finish.
=> Dispatchers.Main.immediate: Runs immediately if already on the main thread, avoiding unnecessary queuing. If not on the main thread, 
it behaves like Dispatchers.Main.
=> Use Main.immediate to reduce delay when already on the main thread.
=> Runs immediately if already on the main thread, otherwise behaves like Main ( immediate execution on the main thread 
without queuing)
Use Dispatchers.Main when you want to ensure execution happens after other main-thread tasks.

3. Bridge + Dependency Injection
	Bridge Pattern and Dependency Injection (DI) can be combined to create a flexible, maintainable architecture
	If not -> the dependencies (implementations) are hardcoded inside class -> coupling, less flexible, hard to test
	Using Dependency Injection (Loosely Coupled, More Flexible)
	-> Inject the implementation interface into the abstraction class
