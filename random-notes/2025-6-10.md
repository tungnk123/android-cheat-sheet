5 Android Studio settings that will make your work faster and more convenient
	1. Take control of your Keymap and forget about the mouse forever
	2. Integrate your service accounts and keep everything under control
	3. Plugins — they’re everything
		JsonToKotlin
		Github Workflows
		Azure DevOps or Jira

	4. How to speed-up project build
		I highly recommend increasing the allocated memory in Android Studio settings -> Heap size
		Update gradle.properties

	org.gradle.daemon=true — keeps Gradle running in the background as a daemon, allowing it to reuse resources for subsequent builds
	org.gradle.parallel=true — if project modules are independent, Gradle will build them in parallel (+1 reason to properly modularize 
		your project)

	org.gradle.caching=true — if a file is already in the cache, Gradle won’t rebuild it but will reuse the cached version
	org.gradle.configureondemand=true — gradle will only configure the modules needed for the current task instead of configuring the 
		entire project.

	5. Code snippers & File templates and how to deal with boilerplate
	6. Bonus: How not to lose all your settings and avoid setting everything up again after reinstalling Android Studio?
	=> For now, I recommend using the simplest option: Settings → Manage IDE Settings → Export Settings, since all automated options 
		are either deprecated or broken.

Rulesets in Github:
	Rulesets help you to control how people can interact with branches and tags in a repository.
	A ruleset is a named list of rules that applies to a repository. You can have up to 75 rulesets per repository.
	protected branches

	=> You can control things like who can push commits to a certain branch, or who can delete or rename a tag
	Block force pushes

	if you fork a repository that has push rulesets enabled, the same push rulesets will also apply to your forked repository.

End-to-end encryption (E2EE) works with AES (symmetric) and RSA (asymmetric):
	RSA Key Pair Generation
		Each user generates a public/private key pair (RSA).
		Public key is shared; private key is kept secret.
	Session Key Generation (AES)
		Sender generates a random AES session key (symmetric).
	Encrypt Message (AES)
		Sender encrypts the message using the AES session key and IV (AES/CBC).
	Encrypt Session Key (RSA)
		Sender encrypts the AES session key using the recipient's public RSA key.
	Send Encrypted Data
		Sender sends:
		cipherText (encrypted message),
		encryptedSessionKey (encrypted AES key),
		iv (initialization vector)

	Decrypt on Receiver Side
		Receiver uses their private RSA key to decrypt the AES session key.
		Then decrypts the message using that AES key and IV.
=> Only the sender and the recipient ever know the AES session key.
The server never knows the message or the session key — it's just a relay.
