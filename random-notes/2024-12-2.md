1. Each thread has its own memory and resources
switching between threads involves more overhead
=> leading to higher resource consumption when dealing with many threads
2. for (i in range (1..4))
=> repeat(4)
3. nesting a Column with Modifier.verticalScroll() inside a LazyVerticalGrid
LazyVerticalGrid: takes up all available height
verticalScroll modifier: expect finite height constraints
4. 

```

data class CategoryWithVod(
@Embedded
val category: XtreamVodCategory,
@Relation(
    parentColumn = "category_name",
    entityColumn = "category"
)
val xtreams: List<XtreamVod>

```

)

5. Extract code block to function (one level of absraction)

```
    	private fun setupRecyclerView() {
	    	setupCategoriesAdapter()
	    	setupFavoritesAdapter()
	    	setupContinueWatchingAdapter()
			}

```

6. AppConstant can have more than 1 object to store some specific constants of many type
object PagingConfigConst
object PagerTransformerConst
object DirectStoreType
7. Flow in DAO vs suspend in DAO and Flow in repository
Flow in DAO: Reactive, less botlerplate code, but limited custom logic, no error handling
suspend in DAO and flow in repository: extensive custom logic, error handling but more boilerplate code
no reactive
=> for reactive updates -> use flow in DAO
=> for custom logic, error handling -> use suspend DAO and flow in Repository
8. toInt() -> toIntOrNull()
9. list.chunked(size) -> Splits this collection into a list of lists each not exceeding the given size.
The last list in the resulting list may have fewer elements than the given size.
10. Preview in Figma -> can run gif, json
