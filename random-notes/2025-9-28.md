Thread communication mechanisms:
	Pipes:
		Java-specific, not Android-only.
		Provides a one-way channel between two threads in the same process.		
		Works like a circular buffer; only the connected threads can access it.
		Good for continuous data transfer between a producer and consumer thread.
		Transfers binary or character data until closed.
		Ensures thread safety.

	Shared Memory
		Threads communicate via heap memory (shared objects).
		Local variables are private; instance or class variables are visible to multiple threads.
		Object references are on the stack, but actual objects live in the heap.
		Widely used but requires synchronization to avoid race conditions.

	BlockingQueue
		High-level Java abstraction solving the producer-consumer problem.
		Threads put and take elements safely with built-in blocking/waiting.
		Provides safe handoff of arbitrary objects without manual signaling.

	Android Message Passing
		Android-specific system for thread communication.
		Components: Handler, Looper, MessageQueue, Message.
		Pattern:
			Producer thread inserts a message using Handler.
			Looper retrieves messages sequentially.
			Handler(s) process them on the consumer thread.
		 Enables non-blocking producer-consumer pattern (common in UI thread + background work).

=> 	Pipes: direct, one-way, safe channel.
	Shared memory: flexible, needs synchronization.
	BlockingQueue: high-level, producer-consumer safe.
	Android Message Passing: platform-specific, non-blocking messaging for UI + background.

AndroidX State:
	Treat lifecycle as data (states), not a tangle of callbacks.
	Use repeatOnLifecycle(STARTED) or flowWithLifecycle for cancellation-safe Flows.
	In Fragments, prefer viewLifecycleOwner for anything that touches views.
	Implement DefaultLifecycleObserver, not `@OnLifecycleEvent`.
	
	lifecycleScope.launch { repeatOnLifecycle(STARTED) }
	viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch { repeatOnLifecycle(STARTED) }
	flow.flowWithLifecycle(lifecycle, STARTED).collect { … }
	Observers: use DefaultLifecycleObserver (not @OnLifecycleEvent).
