1. Why Your Kotlin Code Might Be Slower Than You Think (And How to Fix It)
	1). Overusing copy() in Data Classes
	-> If your object has many properties or is deeply nested, this can become memory and CPU intensive.

	2). Default Arguments in Inline Functions
	-> using default arguments in inline functions can increase method count and cause unwanted overloads

	3). Using List.map Inside Layouts or Loops (frequently recomposed Composables or RecyclerViews)
	-> Fix: Cache transformations using remember in Compose or move them outside tight loops.
	
	Exp: val titles by remember(items) { derivedStateOf { items.map { it.title } } }

	4. Using forEach with Lambdas in Hot Paths
	-> extra function objects and allocations
	-> Use the classic for (item in list) in hot loops or performance-critical sections

	5). Forgetting inline class or value class
	-> @JvmInline value class
	-> removes object allocation

	6. Using BigDecimal Instead of Double Unnecessarily
	-> Use Double or Float unless you're dealing with actual monetary or scientific precision

	7). Forgetting to Profile!
	-> Fix: Use Android Studio Profiler or tools like Trace, Systrace, or Compose Performance Metrics to measure real impact.

2. Kotlin Inline Value Classes
	provide type safety without runtime overhead
	-> act as lightweight wrappers around a single value but are inlined by the compiler to avoid creating extra objects

	Using a data class like data class UserId(val id: Int) helps with type safety, 
	-> but creates an object at runtime, leading to memory overhead especially when used in large numbers.

	@JvmInline
	value class UserId(val id: String)
	
	-> Must have only one val property.
	Cannot have backing fields.
	Can include functions, properties (via get()), and even secondary constructors.

	=> Zero runtime overhead: The wrapper is removed during compilation.
	Type safety: Prevents passing the wrong type to functions.
	Code clarity: Clarifies the meaning of values like Price, UserId, etc.

	Prefer over typealias when type distinction matters

	Usecase:
		Ensure Type Safety: @JvmInline value class UserId(val id: Int)
		Avoid Runtime Overhead: a wrapper around a single value but don't want the performance cost of an objec
		Make Domain Concepts Explicit: @JvmInline value class Email(val value: String); @JvmInline value class Price(val amount: Double)
		Replace Type Aliases for Safer Code
			typealias UserId = Int -> @JvmInline value class UserId(val id: Int)
		Implement Simple Value Objects: small types, units, measurements, currencies

	=> UserId, ProductId, Currency, Primitives values
