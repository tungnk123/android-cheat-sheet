1. Favor object composition over class inheritance.
    - Inheritance = white-box reuse; compile time; easy to use, easy to modify the implementation; but can change at run time;
    The implementation of a subclass becomes so bound up with the implementation of its parent class
    => inheritance breask encapsulation
    => subclass depend on parent class
    - Object composition = black-box reuse; run time; dont break encapsulation; fewer implemenation dependency;
2. FloatingWidget with Service
3. ForegroundService vs BackgroundService
    - startForegroundService() -> foreground service
    - startService() -> background service
    
    - foregroundService:
        - Runs with a higher priority and is less likely to be killed by the system
        - Requires a persistent notification to inform the user that the service is active
        - Suitable for critical tasks such as music players, GPS tracking, or floating widgets
        
        => The user needs to be informed that the service is active (e.g., a music player, floating widget).
        => run continuously without being stopped by the system.
        
    - backgroundService:
        - Runs in the background without a visible notification
        - Restricted starting from Android 8.0 (API level 26).
        - Background services may be stopped by the system if the app isn't actively used.
        
        => For tasks that don’t need to persist continuously or don’t require user awareness.
        
4. Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O
    - Dispatcher.Default vs Dispatcher.Main
    Dispatcher.Default: CPU-intensive tasks only, not blocking tasks
    uses a thread pool with a count equivalent to the number of CPU cores in your machine (min is 2)
    **.limitedParallelism(numberOfCore)**: limit the core used to run
