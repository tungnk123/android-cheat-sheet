How Senior Engineers Think Differently: 10 Mental Models You Need
	Number 9:
		🔴 Junior: “I will fix it when something breaks.”
		🟢 Senior: “I anticipate failures before they happen.”
	=> They Design for Failure: Retries & fallbacks for network failures; Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures; 
		Rate limiting & throttling to handle traffic spikes
	=> They Set Up Monitoring & Alerts: set up real-time monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus, Datadog, etc.) to catch problems before 
		users notice.
	=> They Automate Preventative Measures: write automated tests and CI/CD pipelines.

	Number 10:
		🔴 Junior: “I’ll do it manually every time — it’s just a small task.”
		🟢 Senior: “I’ll automate it and document the process so no one has to waste time on this again.”
	=> ✅ Automating repetitive tasks to save time and reduce errors.
	✅ Documenting solutions so others don’t have to reinvent the wheel => Maintains README files, API specs, and troubleshooting guides
	✅ Creating self-service tools that empower teams to move faster => Builds internal dashboards, scripts, or bots

=> Share knowledge; Keep things simple; take feedback well; listen first, then speak; Own your mistakes; Plan ahead
