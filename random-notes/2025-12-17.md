1. Dear Startups: Stop Making Your Mobile Developers Do This
	- Stop Expecting Us to Be Backend Engineers
		- We didn’t sign up to:
		- Design authentication flows from scratch
		- Secure APIs
		- Manage serverless deployments
		- Monitor uptime
		- Debug server logs from a different time zone
		- **Hire a backend engineer**
	- Stop Handing Us Incomplete, Unusable Designs
		- **Design is not decoration.** It’s functional instruction. If it’s not ready, don’t throw it over the fence.
	- Stop Expecting Mobile Devs to Be QA
		- **If you don’t have QA, YOU are QA.** Not the mobile developer.
	- Stop Using Us as a Stopgap for “Full Stack” Gaps
	- Stop Underestimating the Time and Cost of “Small Features”
		- _“Just a small change. Can’t take more than a few hours.”_
		- **Stop scoping features based on how fast you _think_ they should be. Ask. And listen.**
	- Stop Expecting Real-Time Miracle Fixes
	- Stop Thinking “Cross-Platform” Solves Everything
		- **Cross-platform doesn’t replace native. It adds another layer.** Be realistic about tradeoffs.
2. Why MVVM ?
	- “Separation of concerns”
	- “Clean architecture”
	- “Scalability”
	- Not work
	- For the first version, I’d actually keep this logic in the ViewController.  If it starts growing or becoming painful to test, I’d extract a ViewModel.
	- I don’t start with architecture.  
	- I start with questions:
		- How fast do we need to ship?
		- How likely is this screen to change?
		- Who maintains this after me?
		- What’s the simplest thing that won’t hurt us?
	- _MVVM makes sense once this logic grows. Until then, I’d keep it simple and refactor when it starts to hurt._
3. **ExoPlayer (Media3)** is wrapped in `Media3MusicPlayer`.
	- UI talks only to **ViewModel**, ViewModel talks to **MusicPlayer interface**.
	- Player exposes state via **StateFlow** (reactive, single source of truth).
4. Never allow `valueFrom == valueTo == 0` (crash).
	- Update slider **only when** `**duration > 0**`.
	- Use `isUserSeeking` flag to avoid conflict while dragging.
	- Throttle updates if needed.
5. **Marquee Text (Song Title)**
	- Default marquee breaks when Slider updates layout
	- **Bullet-proof fix**: custom `MarqueeTextView` overriding `isFocused()` to always return `true`.
	- Do not reset `isSelected` repeatedly.
	- Do not re-set text unless track actually changes.
	- `android:marqueeRepeatLimit="marquee_forever"`
	- bug loss focus with slider -> wrap in a linear layout
