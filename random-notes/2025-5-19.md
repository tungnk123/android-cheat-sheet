Why Most People Stay Average (Backed by Science)
	Sometimes, to get better results, you don’t need more effort — just better strategy
	The Pareto Distribution

	If 20% of your actions produce 80% of your results, then your resources (time, energy, money) shouldn’t be spread out evenly.

	Pareto Distribution in Practice
	1. Personalized Marketing vs. Mass Marketing
	=> Fewer emails, aimed at the right people, generate more income.

	2. Dining with the Right People vs. Mass Networking
	=> invite the 10 key people in your industry to a business lunch

	3. The 1% Clients
	=> A business may be convenient for many, but crucial for a few. Focus on those few.

	4. Relationships: The Myth of Hundreds of Friends
	=> just need 4 - 5 friends

	
What happens if a Flow throws an exception?
	if a Flow throws an uncaught exception, the collection is immediately cancelled. 
	No further emissions are processed, and no further code inside collect will execute.
	Unhandled exceptions inside a flow cancel the collection immediately.
	No further emissions are processed after an exception.
	To handle errors gracefully, use the catch {} operator before collect().
