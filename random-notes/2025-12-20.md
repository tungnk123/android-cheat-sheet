1. Ten stupid simple behaviours that make people respect you more
	- Stop always being available.
	- Talk less.
	- **Be relaxed and move slow.**
	- Sharpen up your physical appearance.
	- **Talk a fraction slower.**
	- **Know your boundaries and exert them. -> Say NO**
	- Dress well.
	- Stop trying to impress everyone.
	- **Hold people's eye. -> Keep eye contact**
	- Take up more space.

1. Ultra-Optimized RecyclerView Alternatives Using Compose Lists: When to Abandon Traditional Android
	- #### Key pain points:
		- ViewHolder rebinding on every scroll
		- Main thread blocking due to DiffUtil computation on larger dataset
		- Mutable State Management over Adapter and Activity/Fragment
	- The list implementations in compose, like **LazyColumn, LazyRow,** and the recently added **LazyGrid**, use a whole different architecture under the hood.
		- **Intelligent Recomposition**: The Compose compiler plugin knows which composables need to be re-composed. If the state of your item did not change, no recoomposition occurred. No diffing algorithm overhead.
		- **State Management** — Jetpack Compose plays nicely with **ViewModel,** **MutableState** and also various modern state libraries such as **Kotlin Flows** and Redux pattern. One place (your list's source of truth).
		- **Animations are part of the Compose** — The animation APIs in Compose are first-class; **animateItemPlacement, AnimatedVisibility** Assignments No brittle synchronization between adapter state and animation duration computations.
	- Migration is more than about code hygiene. Teams report measurable improvements:
		- **Memory footprint**: 30–40% less on list-heavy screens
		- **Frame drops**: Jank is almost eliminated while fast scrolling
		- **Time-to-interactive**: 20–50% faster screen composition
		- **Maintainability of code**: equivalent functionality in 60% fewer lines
	- LazyColumn makes infinite scrolling, pagination and gesture handling as a piece of cake.
- 2. The 2026 FAANG Android Developer Interview Roadmap
	- They focus on **software engineering maturity**, **problem-solving ability**, and **system-level thinking** — with Android serving as the execution layer.
	- **~70%** Software Engineering (DSA, design, communication)
	- **~30%** Android-specific knowledge
	- You are evaluated as an **engineer first**, and then as an Android developer.
	- DSAS: Arrays, String, HashMap, Stack, Queues, Tree, Graph, 2 pointer, sliding window, backtracking, dynamic programming
	- **Performance Knowledge**
		- Memory leaks & LeakCanary
		- ANRs: causes & prevention
		- RecyclerView optimization
		- Cold start vs warm start
		- UI jank & frame drops
	- **Networking, persistence and offline-first**
		- Retrofit & OkHttp
		- REST (GraphQL basics help)
		- Paging 3
		- Room (transactions, migrations)
		- Caching strategies
		- Offline-first architecture
		- Sync & conflict resolution
	- **Testing**
	- **Mobile system design basics**
