Don’t Go Into Your System Design Interview Without Mastering This.
	Part 1: Clarifying the Scope — v.v.important (NEVER MISS THIS)
		Data Policies: Retention policies, storage policies
		Data Types: text, media, structured data, unstructured data
		Data Processing: Real-time processing, batch processing
		Performance Requirements: Latency requirements, performance metrics
		Functionalities: core features, additional capabilities
		End Users: User profiles, User count	
		Traffic Expectations: peak load, scalability plans

	Part 2: Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements
		Functional: User actions, system behaviors, business logic
		Non - Functional: scalability, performance, availability, fault tolerance, security

	Part 3: Essential Estimation Toolkit
		Traffic = Operations Per Second
		Queries Per Second
		Requestes Per Second
		Transaction Per Second
		Events Per Second
		Throughput = total work done per second
		Latency = time for a single operation -> lower latency = faster response
		Bandwidth = data transfer rate per second
		TTL = Time to Live = validity duration of cached items before expiration

Realm vs Room in android:
	Realm:
		Object-oriented database (NoSQL-like)
		Pure object-based (no SQL needed)
		Local NoSQL
	=> faster development, real-time sync across devices or built-in encryption, dealing with complex object graphs or need better 
		performance.
	Room:
		Abstraction layer over SQLite
		SQL
	=> prefer SQL and tight integration with Jetpack/Android Architecture Components.

My Top 3 Learnings After 3 Years in Corporate
	1. Don't get stuck to your tech stack. You are replaceable.
	=> learn new stacks regularly; don't resist change - explore it
	=> learn some other life skills: cooking, lifting weights, play music, ...

	2. Keep interviewing — even if you're not planning to leave.
	=> Interviews sharpen your thinking & updates you with the latest trend on what's happening

	3. Document your work. Show your visibility.
	=> Maintain a document with key tasks, bugs fixed, features shipped.
	=> Do write documentations if you got mastery in a particular topic & share in your team channels

JetChat:
	sophisticated shared element transitions between list and detail screens
	.sharedBounds(
                rememberSharedContentState(
	
	animateColorAsState, animateDpAsState(
		targetValue = if (isExpanded) 200.dp else 100.dp,
    		animationSpec = spring(),
    		label = "size"
	)
	

Update StateFlow with update {} over set value directly:
	thread-safe: atomic operation -> no race conditions
	concise: Reduces boilerplate code by eliminating the need to reference the state value twice.
	Immutable-friendly
	Readability: clearly showing the transformation from current state to new state
=> just modifying part of a data class or working in a multithreaded/coroutine-heavy environments
=> use value = when you are sure no concurrency issues will occur or when setting a new state entirely.
