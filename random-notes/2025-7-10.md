ColorRes vs ColorInt
	@ColorRes
		color resource id
		Type: Int (a pointer into RES)
		R.color.blue_500 (pointer to 0xf1213123)
	=> Use in XML or code that references resources
	=> DONT USE in API that expects the actual ARGB value (colorText, background)
	@ColorInt:
		Type: Int (0xAAasdqwe)
		ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.blue)
val viewList by lazy {
	
}		

=> UI setters need @ColorInt (setTextColor, backgroundColor)
=> Resource Helper return @ColorRes (R.color.*, TypedArray.getColorStateList())
=> Convert with ContextCompat.getColor()
		

The Holder Pattern in Kotlin for Android Developers
 	Two of those decisions involve choosing how you pass objects around and how you extend existing behaviour.

	A Holder is a class whose primary job is to own one (or sometimes a handful) of important objects and protect them from being lost 
		or garbageâ€‘collected.
