1. **Bug Summary**
	On first app launch, the database is copied from assets to internal storage _asynchronously_. Screens try to use the database before the copy finishes, so there is no data on first launch. On second launch, the DB already exists, so it works.
	
	**Root Cause**
	Database initialization is not guaranteed to complete before other screens access it.
	
	**Fix Summary**
	- Initialize / copy the database in `Application` (using an IO coroutine).
	- Expose the init `Job` and in the splash screen (or first screen), `join` that job so the app only proceeds once the database is ready.
	- All other screens are opened only after the splash confirms the database is fully initialized.
