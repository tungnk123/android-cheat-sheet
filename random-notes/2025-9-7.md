Android Application Thread
	all threads â†’ Backed by Linux native pthreads, represented by Thread in Java. Android assigns extra properties.

	1. UI Thread (Main Thread)
		Starts with app launch, lives for the whole process.
		Runs Android components & UI updates.
		UI updates from other threads â†’ CalledFromWrongThreadException.
		Sequential event handler for system & app events.

	2. Binder Threads
		For inter-process communication (IPC).
		Managed as a thread pool in each process.
		Handle requests from system services, intents, content providers, bound services.
		Normally hidden from apps â†’ except when using AIDL-bound services.

	3. Background Threads
		Created explicitly by the app (e.g., Thread, Executor, coroutines).
		No predefined purpose, just execution contexts.
		Descendants of the UI thread â†’ inherit its priority.
		In Linux they are plain threads, only Android enforces UI-thread-only updates via WindowManager.

	ðŸ‘‰ Key idea:
		UI thread â†’ main, sequential, UI-only.
		Binder threads â†’ IPC handlers.
		Background threads â†’ app-created workers.

Linux Process & Threads in Android
	Android apps run as Linux processes in a sandboxed environment.
	Each app process is forked from the Zygote process, inheriting system resources and configuration.

	Process Properties
		UID (User ID): Each app is treated as a unique Linux user.
		PID (Process ID): Unique identifier for each process.
		PPID (Parent PID): Parent of all app processes is Zygote.
		Stack: Stores local variables and function calls.
		Heap: Private memory space of the process (not shared with others).

	Process vs Thread
		Process: Isolated execution unit; no shared memory with other processes.
		Thread: Belongs to a process; shares the processâ€™s memory and resources.
		Threads â†’ faster communication (shared address space).
		Processes â†’ safer isolation (separate address space).

	Key Points
		On start, each app process creates one main (UI) thread automatically.
		A process must have at least one thread to execute.
		Additional background threads can be spawned as needed.
=> Processes = isolated, secure, heavy.
Threads = lightweight, shared memory, fast communication.
In Android: every app = one Linux process (from Zygote) + at least one UI thread.
