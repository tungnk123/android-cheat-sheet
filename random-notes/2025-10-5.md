join vs await vs joinAll() vs awaitAll()

Kotlin 2.2.20 for Android Developers
	1. Smarter overload resolution with suspend function	
		fun log(block: () -> String)
		fun log(block: suspend () -> String)
		Normal call -> Error: ambiguous call between overloads
		
		Old solution:  use ugly type casts
			log({ "Hello" } as () -> String)

		New version of Kotlin: use suspend keywork
			log (suspend { "Hi" })
		
	2. return in Expression Body Functions
		you can use return inside expression bodies as long as type is explicit.
		fun getUserName(user: User?): String = user?.name ?: return "Guest"

	3. Smarter Exhaustiveness Checks in when
		Now Kotlin 2.2.20 recognizes handled cases and let you skip redundant branch.
		if (role == Role.ADMIN) return 100
    
    		return when (role) {
        		Role.MEMBER -> 10
        		Role.GUEST -> 1
    		} // âœ… No else needed

	4. Reified Exceptions in catch
		Catching exceptions with generics used to require boilerplate is checks.

	5. Build & Gradle Improvements
		Smarter incremental compilation â†’ inline lambda changes now trigger correct recompilation across modules.
		Cleaner dependency declarations (experimental) â†’ less repetition in Gradle files.
		Improved compiler metrics â†’ easier to analyze build performance in CI/CD.
	ğŸ‘‰=>  End result: fewer flaky builds and slightly faster compiles.
