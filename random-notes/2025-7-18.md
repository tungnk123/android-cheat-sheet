Question 1: What happens if an Activity calls finish() inside onCreate?
	The Activity starts, calls finish(), and exits. No screen is shown. No interaction occurs. But what happens in the lifecycle?
	finish() inside onCreate() prevents onStart() and onResume()
	Only onCreate() and onDestroy() are called
	The Activity never becomes visible

	If finish() is called in onStart(), the system completes onStart() but skips onResume(). The Activity then proceeds to onStop() 
		and onDestroy().
	
	
Question 2: What happens if you call startActivity() using applicationContext?
	You can call startActivity() using applicationContext. The method exists, the Intent is valid, and the code compiles. 
	But unless you add the correct flag, the app crashes at runtime.

	Activity Context can launch activities without flags
	applicationContext requires FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
	Without the flag, the app crashes even if the code looks valid
