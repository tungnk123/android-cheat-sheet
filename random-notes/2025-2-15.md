1. Fetching data sequentially (one after the other) is inefficient, especially when:
Each request is independent
Network calls are time-consuming
User experience suffers
2. Exp: for (id in ids) {
names.add(getCarNameById(id)) ❌ // Wrong: Calls run one after another, wasting time!
}
    
    -> We can fetch all data concurrently using async {} inside coroutineScope {}.
    Optimized Code Using async-awaitAll (Good Code)
    fun getCarNames(ids: List<Int>): List<String> {
    return coroutineScope {
    ids.map { id ->
    async { getCarNameById(id) } // ✅ Runs all requests in parallel!
    }.awaitAll() // ✅ Waits for all coroutines to complete and returns results
    }
    }
    
3. Catching CancellationException in Suspend Functions:
catching CancellationException without properly rethrowing it back to the parent
=> This leads to unexpected behavior, where canceled coroutines continue running when they should stop immediately,
potentially causing memory leaks and wasted resources.
When a coroutine is canceled (e.g., due to a lifecycle event like Activity destruction), it throws a CancellationException
=> If you catch this exception and do not rethrow it, the parent coroutine won’t know it was canceled!
=> This can cause memory leaks, UI lag, and unnecessary background processing.
=> wasted CPU cycles and memory leaks

```
catch (e: Exception) {
    if (e is CancellationException) throw e // ✅ Rethrow CancellationException!
    println("Emmanuel iyke: code not working") // ✅ Handle other exceptions properly
}

```

not checking if the coroutine is still active while executing long-running tasks
If a coroutine is canceled but your loop keeps running, the coroutine never actually stops
-> Wasted CPU resources, Memory leaks, UI lag or app crashes

When job.cancel() is called, the coroutine is marked as canceled, but since there's no explicit check like isActive,
ensureActive(), or a suspending function like yield() or delay(), the loop will keep running

Calling job.cancel() only marks the coroutine as canceled. However, unless the coroutine reaches a suspension point
(such as delay()) or checks its cancellation status manually, it will keep executing.
=> use isActive or ensureActive()

If you call job.cancel() and then assign job = null, it will not immediately stop the loop unless the coroutine itself
checks for cancellation
Assigning job = null only removes the reference to the job, but the coroutine itself is still running in the background
=> 	job.cancel() is not enough if the coroutine does not check for cancellation.
Assigning job = null does NOT stop the coroutine; it only removes the reference.
Always use isActive or ensureActive() inside a long-running loop to properly stop execution.
