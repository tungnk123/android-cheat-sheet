integrating MVI + Clean Architecture with Clean Code guidelines and TDD
	-> modular, testable, and maintainable
	Write simple, meaningful code: Keep your code easy to understand and maintain by following Clean Code principles (e.g., single 
		responsibility, good naming, DRY).
	Test-first approach: Use TDD to write reliable and maintainable code from the start. Ensure you have coverage for business logic, 
		repositories, and the UI.
	Avoid over-engineering: Don’t introduce unnecessary complexity until it’s absolutely needed. Start simple and refactor as the app 
		grows.
	Separation of concerns: Keep UI-related logic in the Presentation Layer, business logic in the Domain Layer, and data handling in 
		the Data Layer.
