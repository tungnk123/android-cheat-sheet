1. architecture components benefits
    - lifecycle awareness => prevent memory leaks, crashes, respect to the activity/fragment lifecycle
    - data consistency: viewmodel, livedata, configuration change
    - testability: easier to write unit tests
    - reduced boiterplate code: room, annotation processing
    - encourage MVVM architectures,k
2. kapt vs ksp
    - kapt: Supports Java annotation processors, slower, java-compatible
    - ksp: Requires KSP-specific processors, Faster and more efficient, focus on Kotlin-first
3. repository architectural pattern => single source of truth
4. viewmodel
    - store ui's state that survive configuration change
    - business logic
5. LiveData vs MediatorLiveData
MediatorLiveData = subclass of Livedata = observe multiple LiveData sources simultaneously
=> react to change if one or more LiveData sources change
=> produce a single, unified result
6. SingleLiveEvent = subclass of LiveData = handle events that only be triggered once such as show error,
messages, navigate between screens
7. Room: verify SQL queries at compile time; reduce boiterplate code; handle data versioning and migrations; work seamlessly with Android's Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel), flow; unit test
8. database schema = logical structure of a database; specify how data is organized and the relationships among them include: table, column, data type, constraint, relationship between tables
9. Handle one to many in Room
@Embedded, @Relation, @Transaction
10. onDelete = ForeignKey.CASCADE
11. Conflict strategy
    - OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE: Replaces the existing row in case of conflict
    - OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE: Ignores the new data if thereâ€™s a conflict (not the transaction)
    - OnConflictStrategy.ABORT: Aborts the transaction if a conflict occurs (default behavior)
    => but the previous row still effected
    - OnConflictStrategy.FAIL: Similar to ABORT, but only the affected statement fails, not the entire transaction
    - OnConflictStrategy.ROLLBACK: Rolls back the entire transaction if a conflict occurs
    => =>aall the previous row will be rollback
