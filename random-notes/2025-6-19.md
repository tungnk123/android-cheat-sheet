Hidden cost of logging in Android
	Logging is useful in Android development â€” for debugging, tracking errors, etc. But even disabled logs can impact performance 
		if not handled properly.

	Even if logs are disabled at runtime:
		Strings are still built
		Objects are still converted using toString()
		Memory is used unnecessarily
		Garbage collection (GC) is triggered
		Heavy logging can cause UI lag or even ANRs (App Not Responding errors)

	ðŸ’£ Real issues:
		Logging data classes or objects â†’ invokes toString() â†’ can use a lot of memory/CPU
		Using String.format() or Formatter is even heavier (involves locale, parsing, etc.)
		Logging in loops or frequently called methods increases CPU/memory load
		May lead to OutOfMemory errors or ANRs, especially on low-end devices

	 Solution: Use lambdas for lazy evaluation
		Instead of:
			Logger.d("User: $user")

		Use:
			Logger.d { "User: $user" }

	This way, log message is not created unless logging is actually enabled
	Prevents unnecessary work in production builds
	Benchmark shows using lambdas significantly reduces execution time when logs are disabled.

	Profile first, and when performance matters â€” optimize logging too
