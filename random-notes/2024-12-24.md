1. Modern App Architecture
2. How to architect Android apps
    - SOLID principles
    - Architectural boundaries have a maintenance overhead. They produce more code, and once a boundary is in place every future developer has to respect it
    => but hard to read
3. Clean Architecture
    - An app should do one thing and do it well
4. Google’s Modern App Architecture: UI layer, Domain Layer(optional), data layer
⇒ Unidirectional architecture: state only flows up, events only flow down
⇒ Only use Domain Layer when big project or want to prevent code duplication in business logic
5. UI Layer = UI elements + State holder (ViewModel) -> use UI architecture pattern like MVVM, MVI, MVP
Domain Layer = Usecases
Data Layer = Repositories + Data sources
6. good architecture allows delayed decisions
=> code production phase begin before designing, choosing technologies
7. Start with high-level code and work downwards.
=> writing out the use cases first => can know what requirements there are on the repository layer
8. if (intent.resolveActivity(packageManager) != null)
