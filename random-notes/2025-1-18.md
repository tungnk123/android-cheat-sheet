1. `use` function in Kotlin
    - scope function that is specifically designed for working with `Closable` resources, such as **files, streams, or database connections.**
    => ensure that the resource is closed automatically after the block of code is executed, even if an exception occurs
    => prevent resource leaks
2. The `run` function is often used when you need to operate on an object and return a result
3. Inline functions reduce the overhead of higher-order functions by copying the code of the function parameter directly
into the call site
=> useful for small, frequently called functions that are critical to the performance of the code
(inline a function that is used as an argument to another function)
4. `inline` vs `noinline` vs `crossline` vs `reified`
5. Type information is erased at runtime due to `type erasure` in Java and Kotlin
