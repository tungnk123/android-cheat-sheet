1. Raising the Bar with Android StrictMode
	- [StrictMode](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode) is a developer tool which detects things you might be doing by accident and brings them to your attention so you can fix them.
	- StrictMode can greatly help us checking if we are using the Main thread to make I/O operations
	- StrictMode.setThreadPolicy: we are detecting disk reads, disk writes, network, and log that has violations on the Logcat.
	- StrictMode.setVmPolicy: we are detecting that maybe a `SqlLiteCursor` finalized without having them closed, and objects that were not correctly closed (from java.io.Closeable)
2. Use context in ViewModel:
	- Using Application context via `AndroidViewModel`
	- Using DI to inject needed dependencies: Repository, DataStore/SharedPreferences abstraction, ResourceProvider, FileManager, UseCase that wraps context operations
	- If you need resources → use `ResourceProvider`
	- If you need storage → inject DataStore or repo
	- Handling Toasts & Dialogs from ViewModel (the right way)
		- Using `SharedFlow` for events
		- Use a sealed class for dialogs
		- ViewModel never touches `Context`, but still controls **what** happens in the UI.
	- Injecting `ResourceProvider` & `DataStore` via Hilt
		- Implementation using `@ApplicationContext`
		- Hilt module to bind it
