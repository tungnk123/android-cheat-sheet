1. The primary constructor can declare parameters as properties. Use the `val` keyword before the argument name to declare a read-only property and the `var` keyword for a mutable property

	- If you need to perform more complex operations during [instance creation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#creating-instances), place that logic in initializer blocks inside the class body. These blocks run when the primary constructor executes.
	
	- Add as many initializer blocks (`init {}`) as you need. They run in the order in which they appear in the class body
	
	- Secondary constructors are useful when you need multiple ways to initialize a class or for [Java interoperability](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/java-to-kotlin-interop.html).
	
	- class Person private constructor(name: String) { /*...*/ }


2. Object
	- If the value of a read-only property is known at compile time, mark it as a compile-time constant using the `const` modifier. Compile-time constants are inlined at compile time, so each reference is replaced with its actual value. They are accessed more efficiently because no getter is called

	- They must be either a top-level property, or a member of an `[object](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#object-declarations-overview)` [declaration](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#object-declarations-overview) or a [companion object](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#companion-objects).
	    
	- They must be initialized with a value of type `String` or a [primitive type](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html).
	    
	- They can't have a custom getter.

3. Use IO thread for appsharefPreference operations
4. Use buildSpannableString instead of buildString -> keep span format
5. Offscreenlimit in ViewPager
	- The fragment currently visible → **RESUMED** 
	- Any fragment kept alive by offscreenPageLimit but not visible → **STARTED**
	- No offscreenPageLimit -> **CREATED** or **DESTROYED**
6. Use registerForActivityResult() to go to location settings for handling result
7. Align in Jetpack Compose
	- Center one item inside parent	Modifier.align(Alignment.Center)
	- Center all content in Box	contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
	- Center all items horizontally in Column	horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
	- Center one item in Column	Modifier.align(Alignment.CenterHorizontally)
	- Center one item in LazyColumn	.fillMaxWidth().wrapContentWidth(Alignment.CenterHorizontally)
	- Center vertically in Column / horizontally in Row	Use Arrangement.Center
