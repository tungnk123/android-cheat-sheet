1. `value =` vs. `update{}` in Kotlin's MutableStateFlow: Why Thread Safety is Everything
	- there’s a crucial, non-negotiable difference rooted in **thread safety** and **atomicity**.
	- Use value:
		- When the new state **does not depend** on the current state.
		- When you are absolutely certain the update will only happen on a **single thread** (e.g., exclusively on the main thread in a specific architecture).
		- The assignment operation `_state.value = newValue` is atomic (thread-safe) on its own. => NOT ATOMIC
	- Use .update {}
		- the thread-safe solution for modifying state that depends on its previous value.
		- The `update` function internally wraps the **Read-Modify-Write** operation in a single, **atomic block**.
		- It uses a **compare-and-swap mechanism** (or similar concurrency primitives) to ensure that no other thread modifies the value between the moment you read it and the moment you write the new one.
		- When the new state **depends** on the current state (e.g., incrementing a counter, toggling a boolean, or copying/modifying a data class).
		- When updates can occur from **multiple coroutines/threads**.
	- You often see `emit()` used with `SharedFlow` or regular `Flow` builders, but for `MutableStateFlow`, `value =` is more idiomatic.
	- Why is `update{}` more expensive than `value =`?
		- update{} -> CAS mechanism (compareAndSet function)
		- The extra overhead of this thread-safe check is why it's considered slightly more "expensive," but in real-world applications
		- this difference is generally **insignificant** compared to the risk of race conditions from using direct assignment unsafely.
	- Best practice:
		- udpate {}: use with copy instead of create a new object (load data)
2. Kotlin 2.2 Just Changed How You Refactor, Generate and Automate Android Apps
	- 1. Enable Gradle Build Cache:
		- org.gradle.daemon=true -> Reuses Gradle process
		- org.gradle.caching=true 
		- org.gradle.parallel=true  -> Builds independent modules simultaneously
		- org.gradle.configureondemand=true -> Configures only required modules
