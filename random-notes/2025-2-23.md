1. Using Ktor In Jetpack Compose
	Setup → Instantiation of Ktor → Making a request → Deserializing the received response
	val myHttpClient = HttpClient(Android) {
        install(HttpTimeout) {
            requestTimeoutMillis = 10000
        }
        install(ContentNegotiation) {
            json()
        	}
    	}
	val httpResponse: HttpResponse = try {
            myHttpClient.get {
                url {
                    protocol = URLProtocol.HTTPS
                    host = "www.google.com"
                    encodedPath = "path/file.html"
                }
            }
	
	val httpResponse: HTTPResponse = myHttpClient.post("https://www.domain.com/path/file.html")

2. Cold Flow vs Hot Flow
	Cold Flow:
		Start emitting on subscription
		Independent streams for each subscribers
		Does not replay past emissions
	-> Fetching data, lazy calculations
	Hot Flow: 
		Producer always active
		Shared Streams between subscribers
		Can be configured to replay
	-> UI events, state management

3. LiveData vs StateFlow vs SharedFlow
	LiveData: lifecycle-aware, Architecture Components
		Observers are only notified when the associated lifecycle is in an active state (STARTED or RESUMED)
	In a cold stream, the data source (or producer) is inactive until there is a subscriber (or collector)
	In a hot stream, the data source (or producer) starts emitting data regardless of whether there are subscribers
-> LiveData: UI-bound data in legacy Views/Fragments
-> Flow: Continous streams of data
-> StateFlow: State sharing between ViewModel and UI
