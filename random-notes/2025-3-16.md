1. Design Patterns in Android Application Development: Use Cases and Examples
	Decorator:  dynamically add behavior to objects without modifying their structure
	=> This pattern is commonly used in RecyclerView to add item decorations, such as dividers or margins.
	
	Command: encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations
	=> Useful in implementing undo/redo functionality in text editors or drawing apps.

	Prototype:  creates new objects by cloning existing instances instead of creating new ones
	=> when object creation is expensive, such as creating shapes in graphic design tools

	Composite: compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
	=> Used when objects need to be treated uniformly, such as in file systems or UI components with nested views
	
	State: allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes
	=> Useful for implementing workflows or UI components that change behavior based on the state, such as media players.

	Strategy: defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable
	=> Useful for scenarios like dynamic behavior switching, such as payment methods or sorting algorithms

	Template Method: defines the skeleton of an algorithm and lets subclasses fill in the details
	=> Useful when you have a fixed workflow with some steps varying based on the context

2. Repository pattern:
	centralized location -> clean API for retrieving, storing and modifying data
	Easier to handle multiple data sources, switch between them or add new ones in the future without changing much in 
		your app's core logic
	a repository serves as a bridge between the data layer and the business logic of an application, providing a clean 
		and consistent way to access data

3. Why Do We Need Repositories?
	Centralized Data Management: single source of truth
	Separation of Concerns: Repositories separate the data access logic from the business logic
	Abstracting Multiple Data Sources
	-> allows the rest of the app to remain unaffected when switching between data sources
	Easier Testing: Use a fake Repository
	
4. How do you handle multiple repositories in a complex project?
	-> Use a parent repository that delegates tasks to individual sub-repositories

5. epository pattern best practices:
	Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
	Use Interfaces to Define Repository Contracts
	Keep Repository Methods Simple and Focused
	Handle Data Source Switching Gracefully
	Use Dependency Injection for Repository Instantiation
	Expose Data as Flows or LiveData for Reactivity
	Use Sealed Classes for Handling API Responses	

6. CoroutineScope, viewModelScope, and GlobalScope
	CoroutineScope:
		Best for non-UI classes like Helper, Repository, or ShareHelper.
		Runs heavy tasks like file reading and image processing on Dispatchers.IO
		Doesn’t depend on Activity/ViewModel lifecycle, preventing memory leaks.
		More control over coroutine execution.
		You need to manually manage scope (e.g., canceling coroutines when needed).
	viewModelScope, lifeCycleScope:
		tied to lifecycle of viewModel or Activity
	GlobalScope:
		Runs forever unless manually canceled → causes memory leaks.
		Not automatically canceled when Activity or ViewModel is destroyed.
		Might cause issues when interacting with UI, as it runs on a random thread.
