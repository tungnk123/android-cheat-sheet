1. What is the difference between Serializable and Parcelable interfaces in Android?
	Serializable:
		Java interface (reflection-based)
		Slower (due to reflection)
		Simple Implementation(just implement Serializable)
		Higher overhead (extra runtime processing)
	Parcelable:
		Android-specific interface (manual implementation)
		Faster (optimized for Android IPC)
		More complex (implement Parcelable and override methods)
		Best for passing data between activities/fragments via Intent or Bundle

2. lifeCycleOwner vs viewLifeCycleOwner
	lifeCycleOwner: 
		The fragment lifecycle starts when the fragment is created and ends when it is destroyed.
		onAttach, onCreate, onCreateView, onViewCreated, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, onDestroyView, onDestroy
		onDetach
	viewLifecycleOwner: 
		The View lifecycle is different because the Fragment can persist beyond its view.	
		The view is created in onCreateView() and destroyed in onDestroyView().
		This means binding views in onViewCreated() and clearing them in onDestroyView() is a good practice.

	Best Practices
		Use viewLifecycleOwner for LiveData observers in fragments (instead of this).
		Avoid storing references to Views in fragment fields to prevent memory leaks.
		Use onDestroyView() to clean up resources tied to the fragment's view.

3. Context: Application Context, ActivityContext
Context = the bridge between components = 
	=> communicate between components, instatiate components, access components
	- Instantiate components -> Activity, Fragment, Service, Broadcast Receiver
	- Access Components -> access system service, filesystem, resource
	- Communicate components -> access components from another app, use intent-filter
4. UI context vs non-UI context:
	only ContextThemeWrapper is UI context -> Context + Theming
	=> use UI context when inflate any XML, your views are themed
	=> inflate layout with Non-UI context your layout will not be themed

5. BroadcastReceiver
	components in Android that enable communication between the system and the application or between different 
		applications
	receive and respond to events
	device boot, network connectivity changes, incoming SMS, or custom broadcast messages
