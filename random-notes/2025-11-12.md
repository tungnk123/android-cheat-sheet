1. **MVVM Is Outdated: The Modern Android Stack Is MVI + GraphQL + Compose**
	- ==Enter== ==**MVI (Model–View–Intent)**== — a pattern that makes state predictable, testable, and scalable. If you’re still juggling booleans and multiple _MutableStateFlow_ objects in MVVM, it’s time to level up.
	- MVVM often scatters logic across multiple _MutableStateFlows_ and exposes mutable state inconsistently. MVI simplifies this with a **single source of truth** — one immutable UI state and one event channel.
	- In MVI, your Composable **only renders state and emits intents**. It **knows nothing about the ViewModel**, has no access to its internal logic or methods, and **does not perform business logic**.
	- Example:
		- **Data Driven + Jetpack Compose**
		- **MVI + Kotlin Flows**
		- **Hilt Dependency Injection**
		- **MockK for Testing**
		- **Fastlane for automation**
