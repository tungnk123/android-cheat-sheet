Interview exp:
	1. Know Your Fundamentals, but Think Bigger	
	 -> understand how Android fits into the larger system — backend APIs, threading, network reliability, data consistency.

	2. Don’t Treat Interviews Like Tests — Treat Them Like Conversations
	-> Every interviewer is evaluating how you think, not just what you know.
	
	3. You Can’t Fake System Thinking
	-> Learn system design

	4. Preparation Isn’t Linear
	-> prepare soft skills

	5. Rejection Is Data
	Didn’t connect app design with backend design deeply enough.
	Could’ve asked more clarifying questions.
	Could’ve shown curiosity about their product domain (finance).
	-> ask more clarifying questions, show curiosity, system thinking

A modern mobile app is half frontend, half backend.
	real-time message queues, smart caching and CDN logic
=> understands API contracts, caching, and message queues

Learn the basics of REST vs GraphQL.
Understand API versioning, authentication, WebSockets, and event-driven design.
=> You just need to become a context-aware engineer — someone who understands how everything connects.

If you set a WorkManager periodic interval < 15 minutes, it won’t run that often —
 	WorkManager automatically enforces a minimum interval of 15 minutes (MIN_PERIODIC_INTERVAL_MILLIS).
	✅ Summary:
 		PeriodicWorkRequest: minimum = 15 minutes, can’t go lower.
 		To run more frequently → use OneTimeWorkRequest and re-enqueue manually, or use AlarmManager / 					ForegroundService.

registerForActivityResult vs startActivityForResult:
	registerForActivityResult:
		modern, recommended
		type safety with contracts
		lifecycle aware
		no boilerplate code
		no memory leaks
	startActivityForResult:
		deprecated	
		no lifecycle aware
		boilerplate code
		no type safety
		risk of memory leaks
