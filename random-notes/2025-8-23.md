Key API Design Principles
	1. Consistency
		Use consistent naming, casing, and patterns across your API
	2. Simplicity
		Focus on core use cases and minimize complexity
		Aim for intuitive designs that developers can understand quickly
		Remember: The best API is one that developers can use without reading documentation
	3. Security
		Authentication: Verify who is making the request
		Authorization: Determine what theyâ€™re allowed to do
		Input validation: Never trust client data
		Rate Limiting
	4. Performance
		Design for efficiency with appropriate caching strategies
		Consider pagination for large data sets
		Minimize payload sizes and network round trips

Android Design Pattern
	1. Strategy Pattern
		Problem: Long if-else chains that decide behavior 
		Solution: Swap logic with interchangeable strategy classes 
		Takeaway: If your code is choosing "what to do" too often, strategy objects might be the abstraction you're missing.

	2. Abstract Factory Pattern
		Create families of related objects without binding to concrete classes
		
	3. Builder Pattern
		Problem: Messy constructors with too many parameters 
		Solution: Use a fluent DSL-style builder for clarity and safety 
		Takeaway: Kotlin's syntax makes this pattern especially elegant.
