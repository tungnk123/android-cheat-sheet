1. Named & default arguments in Koltin
    - default value -> use default value parameter
2. String.lastChar() -> String is Receiver
3. for a coroutine to be able to start, suspend or terminate, it will need to call some suspending function like join, delay and yield etc
4. suspend (one-shot) and Flow (streaming) use cases
5. When the data type is Flow, you do not need to use suspend for the function. Why?
    - Flow = cold asynchronous stream that can emit values over time and is already designed to handle asynchronous operations
    - Flow: Lazy, aynchronous => doesn't perform any work until it is collected
6. Use suspend for functions that perform one-shot asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching data, making a network request, etc.)
For continuous streams of data (like Flow), no suspend modifier is needed.
=> Flow is inherently asynchronous, and the actual suspension happens when you collect the flow, not when you define it.
7. forEach, forEachIndexed, filter, map, ... are extension functions for Iteratable types (List, Set, Sequence)
8. Activity Class Hierrachy:
Object -> Context -> ContextWrapper -> ContextThemeWrapper -> Activity -> Component Activity -> FragmentActivity
-> AppCompatActivity
    
    => prefer AppCompatActivity for modern apps to leverage compatibility with older Android versions and access to AndroidX libraries.
    
9. In Java you can't call a private member from a static function or another class
=> Kotlin extension functions are regular static functions defined in a separate auxiliary class
=> Extension functions cannot access private members; can only have access to the public API of that class (or protected)
10. Static functions lack the context of an instance, so they cannot access instance-specific data or behavior
=> Static functions operate on the class level, so there's no this reference available to determine which object's
private members to access
=> Allowing static methods to access private members would break this encapsulation because static methods are shared
across all instances and do not represent a specific one.
=> Static functions cannot access private static members
11. Extensions are static Java functions under the hood -> No override for extension functions in Kotlin
12. Overriding in object-oriented programming works based on dynamic polymorphism, which resolves method calls at runtime based on the actual type of the object instance. Since static methods are not tied to any instance, they do not participate in this mechanism.
⇒ Static functions cannot be overridden
⇒ Static functions are resolved at compile time, while overriding relies on runtime polymorphism.
