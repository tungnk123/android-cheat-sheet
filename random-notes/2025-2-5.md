1. Gradle JDK: 17, 18, 1_8
2. Kotlin Bytecode inspector = tool of choice to figure out how Kotlin code gets translated to bytecode
3. if you want to know if a Kotlin construct has some noticeable speed or memory impact, measure your own code on your own target platform
4. A new Function instance will be created every time a lambda is passed as argument then garbage-collected after execution
-> Because it will create a new Function Object
=> Avoid calling standard (non-inline) higher-order functions repeatedly if they are invoking capturing lambdas in order to
reduce pressure on the garbage collector.
5. Boxing overhead
Function objects compiled by Kotlin only implement fully generic interfaces, effectively using the Object type for
any input or output value
Calling a function passed as argument in a higher-order function will actually involve systematic boxing and
unboxing when the function involves primitive types (like Int or Long) for input values or the return value
=> non-negligible impact on performance
=> Calling a high-order function with a argument function using primitive types -> put more pressure on garbage collector
through boxing and unboxing operations
=> inline function: make the compiler inline the function body directly inside the caller code
No Function objects will be instantiated when the lambda is declared
No boxing or unboxing
No methods will be added to the total methods count
No actual function call will be performed
=> improve performance for CPU-heavy code
6. An inline function can not call itself directly or through another inline function
A public inline function declared in a class can only access the public functions and fields of that class
The code will grow in size
7. When possible, declare higher-order functions as inline. Keep them short, moving big blocks of code to non-inline functions
if required. You can also inline functions called from performance-critical portions of the code.
8. Provide Dispatcher with Hilt:
This will cause an error because both functions return CoroutineDispatcher. Hilt wonâ€™t know which one to use when
injecting
Solution: Use @Qualifier Annotation
=> @Qualifier: Tells Hilt that this annotation will be used to distinguish different instances.

```
Step1: Create a Custom @Qualifier Annotation
@Qualifier
@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
annotation class Dispatcher(val dispatcher: M3uDispatchers)

enum class M3uDispatchers {
		Default,
		IO,
		Main
}

Step2: Use @Qualifier in @Provides Functions
	@Dispatcher(M3uDispatchers.Default)

Step3:  Inject the Correct Dispatcher
	@Dispatcher(M3uDispatchers.IO) private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher

```

=> Avoids Confusion When Injecting if multiple CoroutineDispatcher instances exist; swap dispatchers easily for testing

10. Map Resource in Kotlin:
fun <T, R> Flow<Resource<T>>.mapResource(transform: (T) -> R): Flow<Resource<R>> = map { }
=> T: Represents the original type of data being processed.
R: Represents the transformed type (used in mapResource).
11. Bind in Hilt:
@Binds
@Singleton
fun bindPlayerManager(impl: PlayerManagerImpl): PlayerManager

```
=> The @Binds annotation tells Hilt how to bind an interface to its implementation
@Binds only works with interfaces as return types.

EntryPointAccessors: access a manually defined Hilt entry point (Since Composable functions cannot receive constructor injections)

```

12. destructuring declaration = destructure an object into a number of variables
val (name, age) = person
13. Data class:
componentN(): automatically generated for data classes
=> allow an object to be split into multiple variables using destructuring
Exp in MutableState:
component1(): Returns the current value
component2(): Returns the setter function
=> componentN() Enables Destructuring
