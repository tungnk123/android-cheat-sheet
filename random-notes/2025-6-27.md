Backpressure Strategies: Managing the Flow's Pace
	a fast-paced data producer (like a sensor emitting values rapidly) and a slower consumer (like a UI updating at a limited 
		frame rate)
	-> back pressure
	=> it can result in memory issues, dropped data, or even application crashes
	
	buffer(): creates an internal buffer to store emissions when the producer is faster than the consumer
		BufferOverflow.SUSPEND (default): The producer suspends until there's space in the buffer.
		BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST: Discards the oldest element in the buffer to make space for new ones.
		BufferOverflow.DROP_LATEST: Discards the newest element if the buffer is full.

		buffer(capacity = 2, onBufferOverflow = BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST)

	conflate(): This strategy discards intermediate values when the collector is too slow, always processing the latest value.

	sample(periodMillis: Long): This operator emits the latest value from the flow periodically.


You should never add your own parameterized constructors to a Fragment or DialogFragment because the framework needs a public no-argument constructor to re-create it in situations like:
 	Configuration changes (e.g. screen rotation)
 	Process death and restoration (when your app is killed in the background and later brought back)
 	FragmentManager restoring the back-stack
=> no argument constructor
=> Use arguments (a Bundle)
	Automatic state saving & restoration
	Keeps the no-arg constructor intact
	Official best practice: use a newInstance(...) factory method that fills an arguments bundle
	No crashes or missing data.
