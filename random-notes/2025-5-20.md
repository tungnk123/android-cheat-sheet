Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle in Android: Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
	Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.	
	=> reduce bugs, make your codebase easier to maintain, improve readbility, simplify testing

	How to apply?
	Extension Functions -> add functionality to existing classes without needing inheritance or design patterns like the Decorator
	Higher-Order Functions and Lambda Expressions
	Data Classes and Default Parameters
	Sealed Classes for Type-Safe Handling

	Composable Functions
	Modifiers and Extension Functions
	Slots API Pattern =>  create highly customizable components while maintaining DRY principles
		content: @Composable () -> Unit

parrentFragmentManager vs childFragmentManager vs supportFragmentManager:
	supportFragmentManager: use in Activity
	In fragment:
		parrentFragmentManager -> get fragment manager in acvivity
		childFragmentManager -> get fragment manager that manages the fragment's children 
=> ViewPagerAdapter in a Fragment -> use childFragmentManager
=> fragments inside of a fragment -> childFragmentManager

Handling Backpressure in Kotlin Flows
	Backpressure happens when a producer emits values faster than the consumer can process them.
	Producer: A database stream, A network call repeating every second, A flow of user interactions (like typing)
	Consumer: UI, collector

	If you don’t handle backpressure, your app might:
		Drop important data
		Freeze the UI
		Crash due to memory overload

	1. buffer(): add a queue in the middle
		Use where don’t want your producer to be blocked — like streaming data or user inputs.

	2. conflate(): give the lastest value
		-> if the consumer is too slow, it skips all the intermediate values and delivers only the latest one.
	=> you are showing live UI updates and don’t care about in-between states.
	Think: progress bars, real-time charts, typing indicators.

	3. collectLatest()
		gives the latest emitted value.
		collectLatest cancels the ongoing block and drops the in-progress work whenever a new value is emitted
