5 Times Kotlin Lambdas Made My Code 10x More Elegant
	1). Simplifying List Operations with filter, map, and forEach
	2). Replacing Interface Callbacks with Lambda Parameters
	3). Custom View DSLs and Builders
		fun createUser(block: UserBuilder.() -> Unit): User {
    			val builder = UserBuilder()
    			builder.block()
    			return builder.build()
		}

		// Usage:
		val user = createUser {
    			name = "Samantha"
    			age = 30
		}
	4). Cleaner High-Order Function Use
		
	5). takeIf and let — a Match Made in Kotlin Heaven

Kotlin Practices That Make You Look Like a Senior Dev

	1. Prefer val Over var (And const val Even More)
		-> Use val and const val aggressively in models, utility classes, and function scopes. Kotlin rewards immutability.
		-> Immutability leads to predictable, thread-safe, and easier-to-debug code.
	2. Use Extension Functions Wisely
		-> Don’t overuse them. Keep them focused and meaningful — avoid polluting core types with business logic.
	3. Replace if Trees with when
		-> Use when with enums and sealed classes for exhaustive and compile-time-safe condition handling.
	4. Make Use of Data Classes — But Don’t Abuse Them	
		-> Using data classes when you actually need behaviour. When logic grows, consider converting it to a full-fledged class.
	5. Leverage Null-Safety Features Like a Pro
		-> Use the Elvis operator (?:), safe calls (?.), and requireNotNull() strategically — but avoid !! like the plague.
	6. Keep Functions Short and Focused
		-> Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). One function. One task. Done well.
	7. Favour Readable Lambdas Over Cleverness
		-> Split chains when they get long or when each step has a distinct meaning. It’s easier to debug, test, and understand.
	8. Don’t Skip Documentation — Use KDoc
		-> Use KDoc not just for public APIs but for complex logic, assumptions, and edge cases. It builds trust in your codebase.

Some flow operations: flow
	.onEach {value -> process(value)}
	.catch {e -> handleException(e)}
	.collect()
	.launchIn() -> launch a coroutine in a specific scope

Flow Collector = a piece of code that consume (collect) values emitted by a flow = subscriber to the Flow's emissions
	The code block you pass to collect or collectLatest
	If you call collect twice (even on the same flow), you create two independent subcriptions
	
	Lifecycle-aware collector vs Zombie collectos

repeatOnLifecycle: STARTED
	-> stop collect data on 'onStop'
	-> lifecycle-aware collector 

	=> no duplicate collectors; no work off-screen; prevent null exceptions, crashes; cleaner code
	Using StateFlow just means you immediately get the current value on each subscription 
	-> it does not prevent duplicate collectors

One lifecycleScope and 5 children launch VS 5 lifecycleScope
	One fail -> all fail -> supervisorScope
	=> Recommended one lifecycle-aware block but wrapping its children in a supervisorScope
	=> single lifecycle boundary; cleaner; per-collector fault tolerance

	lifecycleScope.launch
		repearOnLifeCycle
		supervisorScope		
			launch 
				flow.catch {}.collect


SignalR bug 1 week:
	SignalR only support access token in query string, NOT Authorization header
	=> must config in backend
