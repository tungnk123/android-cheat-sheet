1. Coroutine vs Thread
    - lightweight = without significant overhead
    - non-blocking = When a coroutine is suspended (e.g., waiting for a network response),
    it does not block the thread. Instead, other coroutines can run on that thread
    - structured concurrency = coroutines are scoped to certian lifecycle contexts
    - easy cancellation
    - easy to read and maintain
2. **Null safety**
    - non-nullable types (default) vs nullable types
    - safe call operator ?
    => safely access a property or method on a nullable object without risking a null pointer
    exception
    - not-null assertion operator !!
    => enforce this assumption, not null
    - elvis operator ?:
    => provide a fallback value
3. modifier.shadow(
elevation = 8.dp,
shape = RoundedCornerShape,
clip = false	
)
4. release -> create a branch **release** and push with **tags** (v1.4)
5. Box(contentAlignment = Alignment.Center)
modifier = Modifier
.align(Alignment.CenterStart)
6. **SnapHelper** in RecycleView -> smooth scroll
