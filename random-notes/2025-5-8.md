6 patterns every developer should know and actually use
	1. Monolithic Architecture
	-> one codebase, one deployment, and one server to (sometimes) rule them all
	2. Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
	-> Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer
	-> split your app into independent services
	3. Microservices Architecture

	4. Event Driven Architecture

	5. Serverless Architecture

	6. Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture

10 Lessons I Learned from a Principal Engineer That Made Me a Better Developer
	1. Write Code for the Engineer Who Replaces You
	->  I stopped writing clever one-liners and started leaving meaningful comments
	->  wrote clearer function names and modular code
	
	2. Slow is Smooth. Smooth is Fast.
	-> moved calmly, Double-checked assumptions. Asked better questions

	3. Understand the Business, Not Just the Code
	4. Read the Codebase Like a History Book
	-> Don't assume the code is dumb – assume there's a story behind it

	5. Never Say 'Just'
	-> Now, whenever someone says "just," I pause and ask: Is it really that simple?

	6. Choose the Right Abstraction, Not the Most Abstract
	-> 

	7. Learn to Communicate Up, Down, and Across
	-> Communication isn't soft skill fluff – it's a core part of being a senior developer.

	8. Logs Are Your Love Letters to Future You
	-> Good logs are like time machines. They save you more than tests sometimes.

	9. Know When to Leave Things Broken (Temporarily)
	-> "Engineering isn't about perfection," he said. "It's about judgment."

	10. Seniority Is Measured by How Much You Amplify Others
	-> You become a better developer not just when your code improves – but when your team does

Staggered Grid Layout Manager

Property vs constructor parameter (constructor parameter is never used as a property)
	-> can use every where in class, even in function
	-> if not -> just use in constructor or init block
	-> if use -> consume a variable -> waste resource

multi-module architecture:
	app
	core: Shared logic (DI, domain, UI, navigation)
	feature: Isolated features like Albums, Photos, and Videos
	baselineprofile: Optimizing performance from the start
-> Faster build times — Only changed modules are rebuilt
Team collaboration — Developers work on isolated features without conflicts
Better testing — Each module can be tested independently
Scalability — Easier to onboard new developers and scale features
Reusability — Shared logic lives in core — write once, use anywhere
