1. commit() vs apply() in SharedPreferences:
    - commit(): Sync Write ->  race conditions
    - apply(): Async Write; If multiple threads modify preferences, wrap edit() inside a synchronized block
    => Use commit() or synchronized apply() when multiple threads write data
2. Thread safety in SharedPreferences:
    - Thread-safe for Reads: cached in-memory copy
    - Not thread-safe for writes (edit() + apply()/commit())
    - Concurrent writes can cause race conditions.
    - apply() is asynchronous -> It writes changes in the background; Another thread might read old data before the write is completed => data inconsistency in multi-threaded environments
    - commit() is synchronous but blocks the calling thread, which may lead to UI lag if called on the main thread
    
    => **DataStore: built for concurrency and ensures safe reads and writes automatically**
    
    - Uses Kotlin Coroutines and Flow:
    - Reads and writes are performed asynchronously using coroutines.
    - No need to manually synchronize accessAtomic and Consistent Updates:
    DataStore.updateData {} ensures only one write at a time
    If multiple threads modify the same data, the latest version is always consistent
    Utilizes checked IOExceptions, improving app stability by facilitating error handling
    => **DataStore: better performance, thread-safety, security, handle complex objects; migration support**
3. **Atomic Update** =  a write operation is either fully completed or not performed at allâ€”there are no partial updates or data corruption
=> ensures that when multiple threads modify data, there is no risk of inconsistent or lost values
Jetpack DataStore supports atomic updates using the edit {} function
edit {} ensures that only one thread updates the value at a time
No need for synchronized or manual locks!
4. Disadvantages of SharedPreferences
    - Thread Safety: Use OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener for monitoring changes in preference values in a thread safe manner
    -> limitations, on Main thread -> ANR
    - Error Handling: Prone to unchecked runtime exceptions
    - Data Consistency:  Does not provide type safety
5. annotation processing tool:
    - Kapt:  Slow (generates Java stubs),  High (Java reflection), No Multiplatform
    - KSP:  Fast (directly works with Kotlin),  Low (efficient processing)
    
    => **KSP: better performance, decrease memory, native kotlin support, Multiplatform**
    
6. Migrate from kapt to KSP:
    - **Kapt = Kotlin Annotation Processing Tool:**
        - Java annotation processors with Kotlin code
        generating Java stubs from your Kotlin files that the processors can then read
        - => expensive operation and has a significant impact on build speed
    - **KSP = Kotlin Symbol Processing:**
        - Kotlin-first alternative to kapt
        - KSP analyzes Kotlin code directly, which is up to **2x faster**. It also has a better understanding of Kotlin language constructs
7. **Import module** in Android Studio instead of copy it directly -> auto generate gradle file
