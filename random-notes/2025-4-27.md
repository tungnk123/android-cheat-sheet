1. The real difference between Job.cancel() and Scope.cancel()
	A Job represents a single coroutine. It’s returned by launch or async, and gives you control over that specific coroutine — 
		you can cancel it, check its status, or wait for it to finish.
	A CoroutineScope, on the other hand, is a container for coroutines. It holds a CoroutineContext, which usually includes a Job 
		that manages the lifecycle of all coroutines launched within the scope.

	The CoroutineScope interface itself does not define a cancel() function.
	Once a CoroutineScope is cancelled (i.e., its internal Job is cancelled):
		Any new launch {} or async {} calls will not run
		The scope is considered inactive
		This behavior is especially important in Android components like ViewModel or Service, where coroutine scopes are tied 
			to the component’s lifecycle
	=> job.cancel(), scope.cancel(), use lifecycle-aware scopes that are cancelled automatically

2. coroutineScope {} suspends the parent until all its children finish

3.  Structured concurrency ensures safety - but it can confuse you if you’re not watching coroutine lifecycles closely.

4. Launch and async
	launch {} and async {} are extension functions on CoroutineScope.
	They are NOT suspend functions, meaning you don't need to be inside a suspend function to call them.
	
	-> launch and async start a coroutine immediately when you call them.

	You can call launch or async from any normal function, no need for suspend.

	delay(), coroutineScope{}, withContext(): SUSPEND FUNCTIONS
	-> Must be called inside a suspend function or coroutine

	coroutineScope is a suspend function
	-> only return when all children coroutine is finished

5. Nature of suspend function
	A suspend function = function that can pause (suspend) and resume execution without blocking the thread

	coroutineScope {} is a special suspend function.
	It does two important things:
		It creates a parent coroutine.
		Inside, you can launch multiple child coroutines.
	=> coroutineScope {} will suspend itself and NOT return until ALL its child coroutines are completed.
	=> It makes concurrency safe and structured (no abandoned coroutines).
