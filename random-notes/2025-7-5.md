Best Practices for MutableStateFlow.update {}
	Keep your update {} lambdas pure, quick, and sideâ€‘effectâ€‘free to avoid hidden retries and concurrency surprises.

	Your update {} lambda might run multiple timesâ€”so never put side effects inside it.

	A wellâ€‘behaved update {} lambda should always be:
		âš¡ Quick
		ðŸ”’ Atomic
		ðŸ§¼ Sideâ€‘effectâ€‘free

	=> Not Nested update calls or indirect recursion; Expensive computations inside the lambda
