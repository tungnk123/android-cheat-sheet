Clean Architecture in Android: Mastering the Domain, Data & UI Layers
	emphasizes the separation of concerns and unidirectional dependencies

	UI Layer — where user interaction happens
	Domain Layer — the core business logic
	Data Layer — data sources like APIs and databases

	UI Layer (Presentation)
		Responsible for: Rendering UI and handling user interactions.
		Common tools: ViewModel, Jetpack Compose, LiveData/StateFlow.
		Key principle: No business logic here.
	Domain Layer
		Responsible for: Business logic and use cases.
		Common tools: Plain Kotlin classes, interfaces.
		Key principle: Independent of Android SDK and frameworks.
	Data Layer
		Responsible for: Fetching data from remote APIs, local databases, or cache.
		Common tools: Retrofit, Room, DataStore, Repositories.
		Key principle: Implements interfaces from the domain layer.
=> Testability, Readability, scalability, replaceability
=> Usecase: medium to large-scale apps with multiple features, team members and business rules; avoid for tiny apps or quick prototypes
