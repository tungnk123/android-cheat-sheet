1. Testing in android
    - Unit testing: JUnit
    - Integration testing: Mockito
    - UI testing: Espresso
2. Implement CI for android
    - use tools like Jenkins, Github Actions, Gitlab CI
    - automated build
    - auto run test: integrate unit tests, integration tests, UI tests into the CI pipeline to run automatically after each build
3. Design a scalable and maintainable Android application
    - clean architecture -> seperation of concern
    - MVVM pattern
    - Dependency Injection
    - Repository pattern
    - Use of Architecture components: ViewModel, LiveData, Room, Navigaiton
4. Some strategies to ensure codebase is clean
    - Follow SOLID principles
    - Code Reviews
    - Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)
    - Refactoring
    - Consistent Naming Conventions
5. Text(
textAlign = TextAlign.Center)
6. Snack bar
    - brief messages, appear temprarily, shouldn't interrupt the user experience, don't require user input to disappear
    - SnackBar, SnackBarHost, SnackBarHostState
    - snackbarHostState.showSnackbar(
    message = message,
    actionLabel = actionLabel,
    withDismissAction = withDismissAction,
    duration = duration
    )
7. Move shareImage() function to a object ShareUtils
8. object singleton vs class with dependency injection
    - object singleton: very simple, no DI needed; default thread-safe; hard to mock or replace;
    global singleton, not integration with DI
    - class with DI: require DI setup; handle thread-safety by DI, easy mockable; scoped lifecyele;
    fully compatible with DI; can inject dependecies via constructor injection
    
    => use object singleton when: simple project, don't need DI; has no complex depedencies or need to mocking
    in tests; prefer a lightweight Singleton for global use
    => use class with DI when: using Hilt or Koin; need flexibility, inject dependecies into; testability
    and mockability
    
    =>> choose class with DI due to its flexibility, testability, seamless integration with lifecycle
    management
    
9. @Singleton vs @ActivityScoped in Hilt
10. GridLayoutFiveImages -> FiveImagesGridLayout
11. always use getOrNull()
12. Dont use throw exception, not null assertion
=> can return nullable type
