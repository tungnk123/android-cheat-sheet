1. Kotlin for Seniors
	Leverage apply for Clean Object Initialization
		The apply scope function is a great way to initialize objects with less boilerplate
		
	Use asSequence for Lazy Collection Operations
		-> lazy evaluation: computations run only as needed
		
	Embrace Contracts for Better Compile-Time Verification
		-> Kotlin contracts let you define specific behaviors for functions, enabling the compiler to make smarter 
		inferences about code paths.
		
	=> writing functions that perform validations or assertions, ensuring your assumptions hold true at compile time.

2. lateinit vs lazy in Kotlin
	lateinit:
		initialize a variable at the time of the declaration and want to initialize it at some later point in time
	->  UninitializedPropertyAccessException
	lazy:
		lazy in Kotlin is useful in a scenario when we want to create an object inside a class, but that object 
		creation is expensive and that might lead to a delay in the creation of the object that is dependent on 
		that expensive object.

3. In AppSharedPreferences dont use Double -> use Float

4. Float vs Double
	Float:
		32 bit
		6-7 decimal places
		Lower calculation accuracy
		Suffix F
	-> small values, less precision-sensitive tasks
	Double:		
		64 bit
		15-16 decimal places
		Higher calculation accuracy
		No suffix needed
	-> scientific calculations, finance or high-precision computations
=> Float: save memory, dont need high precision, can tolerate some precision loss
=> Double: high precision
		
5. FusedLocationProvider, FusedLocationProviderClient

6. Use viewModel dont need @Inject
-> just use by viewModels()
