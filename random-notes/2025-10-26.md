Inline value class:
	Use for domain identifiers (UserId, Email, CurrencyCode)
	Mark with @JvmInline for JVM interop clarity
	Avoid heavy logic inside, keep them pure wrappers
	Dont rely on toString() for debugging
	Test null and boxing behaviors if passing across module boundaries

Threads and Memory Leaks:
  Threads can prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming memory while running.

Leak Characteristics:
   	Potential Risk: Increases with the thread’s lifetime and retained object references.
  	LeakSize: Small leaks may go unnoticed; large leaks (e.g., bitmaps, views) can quickly exhaust heap memory.

Inner vs. Static Inner Classes:
	Inner classes hold implicit references to their outer class, preventing garbage collection while the thread runs.
  	Static inner classes reference only the outer class’s type, not its instance—reducing leak risk.

Lifecycle Mismatch (Android):
	Component lifecycles (e.g., Activity) often don’t align with object/thread lifecycles.	
	Leaking Activities** are common—if references persist after `onDestroy()`, they remain in memory.
  	Automatically started threads** are riskier, as configuration changes or navigation can spawn many threads still holding Activity references.


A secure way to store API keys in Android applications
	* Using an application properties file (usually local.properties) that is not included in the repository;
	* Storing keys in native code that is called from our application code via JNI.

	* I store the API key in encrypted form in local.properties, and I place the encryption key, as well as the algorithm itself, in the native code. 

	Thus, in order for an attacker to gain access to my API key, they must:
		* Intercept the encrypted API key;
		* Find the encryption key in the native code;
		* Understand the logic of the cryptographic algorithm in the native code.

	Install NDK + CMake (an external build tool that works alongside Gradle to build your native library )

	add the path to NDK in local.properties. 

	add a native build to the build.gradle.kts file of the app module

	I chose XXTEA as the encryption algorithm because it is:
		* easy to implement;
		* fast;
		* relatively robust.

	launch the application,
	take the encrypted API Key from the log,
	replace the value of my_api_key in local.properties with the encrypted one,
	in ApiKeyExtractor, replace the value of the encryption parameter from 1 to 2.
