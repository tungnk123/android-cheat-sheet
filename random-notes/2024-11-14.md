3. ViewModel vs AndroidViewModel
    - AndroidViewModel is subclass of ViewModel.
    - it contains the application context
    - AndroidViewModel has application context
    - AndroidViewModel is a Application context aware ViewModel.
4. HashMap vs Hashtable
    - HashMap = No method is synchronized; Null is allowed for both key and value.
    => multiple threads can operate simultaneously => hashmap's objects is not thread-safe
    - HashTable = Every method is synchronized; Null is not allowed for both key and value.
    Otherwise, we will get a null pointer exception.
    => at a time only one thread is allowed to operate the Hashtable's object
    => thread-safe
