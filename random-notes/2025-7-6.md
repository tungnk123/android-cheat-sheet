All in 1: Mastering Room Database & Kotlin Coroutines in Android: MVVM Architecture, Real-World…
	Use Dispatchers.IO for DB operations
	Always expose immutable LiveData or StateFlow to the view
	Validate Room queries with @Query properly
	Keep ViewModel free from DB logic (use repo)
	Use viewModelScope for lifecycle-safe coroutines

	Don't access Room on the main thread
	Avoid complex joins unless necessary
	Always handle exceptions in coroutines
	Use @Transaction for atomic operations
	Prefer StateFlow in modern UIs (Jetpack Compose)

MVVM vs MVP — Which is better for Room & Coroutines?
-> MVVM is preferred as it works well with lifecycle-aware components, LiveData, and viewModelScope which are coroutine-friendly.

What is the purpose of callbackFlow in Room-related flows?
-> callbackFlow is used when integrating Room or other libraries that emit data via callback, enabling bridging into the Flow world.

What's the difference between LiveData and Flow?
	LiveData: Lifecycle-aware, no backpressure handling.
	Flow: More flexible, supports backpressure, used in coroutines.

How do you handle database migrations in Room?
-> By using Room.databaseBuilder(...).addMigrations(...) and defining Migration objects to handle schema changes across versions.

What is @Transaction in Room?
->  Marks a method that should run in a single database transaction. Useful when multiple DAO calls must succeed or fail together.
