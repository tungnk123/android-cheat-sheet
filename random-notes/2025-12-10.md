1. The Biggest Mindset Shift That Changed My Life
	- ==For years, I’ve proudly called myself an overachiever==.
	- **Happiness doesn’t live in perfection; it lives in perspective.**
	- Inevitably, this would lead to disappointment every time things didn’t meet my exacting standards.
	- **_Expect less. Live more. Laugh often._**
	- Relaxing, enjoying the ride, and keeping expectations realistic have all made a difference.
	- We actually have to relax and enjoy it.
	- **Tasks can wait. Priorities shift. Life keeps moving.**
		- Not everything can be neatly solved or fixed in a predetermined time, like in the movies.
		- Tasks can wait, priorities shift, and yes, deadlines still exist, but now I don’t need to burn all my internal petrol tickets in one go.
	- **Your urgency isn’t their emergency**
	- I learned that a balanced life is essential.
	- Sleep, breaks, hobbies, connection and downtime all matter as much as the “important stuff.”
	- **I found taking time to care for myself made the work I did more effective and enjoyable.**
	- **Giving things a go is more important than getting them perfect.**
	- **Taking care of yourself is part of taking care of life.**
		- Now, for the sake of my mental health, **I dedicate time to things I enjoy.**
		- Sometimes it’s a walk, a gym session, or even just reading a book.

2. CoroutineScope vs. coroutineScope
	- CoroutineScope:
		- `CoroutineScope` **is an interface** in the Kotlin Coroutines library. It's essentially a _contract_ that represents the **context and lifecycle** for new coroutines.
		- **A Holder of Context:** It holds a `CoroutineContext`, which is typically composed of a `Job` (the coroutine's lifecycle) and a `CoroutineDispatcher` (where the coroutine executes).
		- **Lifecycle Management:** Any coroutine launched within a `CoroutineScope` will automatically…
		- **No New Scope Created:** It is just an interface that **must be implemented or provided**.
	- coroutineScope:
		- `coroutineScope` **is a suspension function** (a builder) that is used to **suspend** the current coroutine and **create a new child scope**.
		- **Suspends the Caller:** The calling coroutine will be **suspended** until all coroutines launched within the `coroutineScope` block are complete.
		- **Creates a Child Scope:** It inherits the `CoroutineContext` of its parent but overrides the `Job`. Crucially, it creates a **structured concurrency boundary**.
		- **Returns a Value:** Since it’s a suspending function, the block can return a result when all its children finish.
	- `MainScope()` is simply a pre-built factory function that returns an instance of `**CoroutineScope**` initialized with `**Dispatchers.Main**` and a `**SupervisorJob**`.
3. Explain Proguard/R8. Why Is Code Obfuscation Important?
	- It matters security-wise and also APK size in production.
	- **Proguard** (deprecated) — Shrink, optimize, and obfuscate code
	- **R8 (Modern)**: Replaces Proguard, optimal faster optimizations
	- **What is obfuscation**: It makes reverse engineering your app more difficult. Proprietary algorithms stay hidden.
