Common Mistakes Made by Junior Android Developers
	1. Ignoring Lifecycle Awareness
		Updating UI or triggering actions outside the correct lifecycle method -> onStart

	2. Not Using ViewBinding or Jetpack Compose Properly
	-> use ViewBinding, not findViewById

	3. Blocking the Main Thread
	-> coroutine

	4. Improper State Handling in ViewModels
	->  Modifying UI-related logic directly in ViewModel

	5. Hardcoding Values and Strings

	6. Overlooking Logcat and Debugging Practices
	-> Use meaningful tags, Learn to filter by application PID/package or tag in Logcat, 
	-> Use breakpoints and debug mode; start by reading the stacktrace from bottom to top
	=> Prefer Timber over Log for more structured and maintainable logging.

How to send data between composable host:
	Use Json Serialization
		simple and straighforward		
		no need SharedViewModel
		Data is passed through URL parameter
		Fits well with the Navigation Component pattern
		Requires handling of encoding/decoding
	Use SharedViewModel or SavedStateHandle
		No size limit on data
		No need to serialize/deserialize
		Allows data sharing across multiple screens
		More complex to implement	
		Requires lifecycle management for shared data
		Risk of memory leaks if not properly cleared
