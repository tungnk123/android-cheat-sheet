1. **Don’t Ignore Thread Safety — Design for Concurrency from Day One**
	- A **race condition** in production. A **deadlock** that only appears under specific load or a shared variable mysteriously changing value.
	- Building for concurrency from day one is not about over-engineering. 
	- It’s about acknowledging that almost every modern application — **backend** services, mobile **apps**, **distributed** systems, data pipelines — runs in a **multi-threaded,** **multi-core** world.
	- Why concurrency issues are so dangerous?
		- They are non-deterministic and often hard to reproduce
		- They emerge under load, not during normal development
		- Logging doesn’t always reveal the root cause
		- A single unsafe shared variable can compromise the entire system
		- Minor fixes can introduce new race conditions or performance issues
	- Design principles for concurrency
		- Immutable data first
		- Avoid unnecessary shared state
		- Prefer stateless services
		- Use concurrency-safe primitives and patterns (locks, channels, actors, message queues)
	- Use CodeRabbit to review code
		- Highlight unsafe shared variables, non-atomic operations, not concurrency-safe data structures, multithreading issues
