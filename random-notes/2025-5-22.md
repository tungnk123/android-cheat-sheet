Since API 31, Android 12+ -> ForegroundService must declare what kind of work it is doing
	-> android:foregroundServiceType="microphone"

Functional Programming vs Reactive Programming:
	Functional:
		pure functions, immutable data, synchronous transformations
		high-order functions, map, filter, reduce
	=> transforming static collections or values	
	Reactive:
		streams of events over time, asynchronous/reactive data flow
		Observables/Streams, back-pressure, operators flatMap, debounce, merge

What are Composable Functions in Jetpack Compose?
	a special function in Jetpack Compose that describes a piece of UI
	composable functions focus on what the UI should look like based on the current state, rather than how to render it

	How Composable Functions Work
	1. Composition: 
		The first time a Composable function is executed, it creates the initial UI hierarchy

	2. Recomposition
		Recomposition happens when the state that a Composable depends on changes. 
		Compose automatically re-executes the affected Composable functions and updates only the necessary parts of the UI.

	3. Skipping Unchanged UI
		Compose optimizes performance by skipping parts of the UI tree that haven't changed.

	4. Lifecycle and Disposal
		When a Composable is no longer needed (e.g., removed from the UI), it is "disposed of," freeing up resources. 
		Compose handles this automatically, ensuring optimal memory usage.

	Best Practices for Writing Composable Functions
		1. Keep Composables Small and Focused
		2. Avoid Heavy Computations Inside Composables
			Keep expensive operations outside the composable. Use tools like remember to avoid unnecessary recompositions.
		3. Leverage State Hoisting
			State should be managed at higher levels of the composable hierarchy and passed down as parameters.

		4. Minimize Use of Side Effects
			Side effects should be outside composable functions
		-> use side effect handler
