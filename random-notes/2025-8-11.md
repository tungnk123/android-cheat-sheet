WebRTC (Real-Time Communication)
	WebRTC enables real-time audio, video, and data communication directly between browsers and apps, without requiring 
		plugins.

	Google's WebRTC library for Android-org.webrtc
		the nature of peer-to-peer communication signaling, STUN/TURN servers
	Thrid-party SDKs like Twilio, Vonage, Agora:
		provide easier-to-integrate SDKs that wrap WebRTC 
		=> handle much of the backend complexity signalling, server infrastructure for you

	Usecase:
		Video and audio calls; Live streaming; Screen sharing; P2P file sharing; Online gaming; Remote collaboration
		
	Implementing WebRTC from scratch:
		Accessing Camera and Microphone: Use CameraX for video and AudioRecord for audio
		Signaling = a mechanism for peers to find each other and exchange connection information; WebSockets
		PeerConnection
		STUN/TURN servers
		Rendering video: use SurfaceViewRender

Cancel a coroutine:
	If a job is launched in `viewModelScope`, it will be automatically canceled in `onCleared()` without your intervention.
	Manual cancellation is only needed if you want to stop it early or if the job is not tied to `viewModelScope`.
	Setting it to `null` is optional â€” it only helps clear the reference and makes the code clearer.
