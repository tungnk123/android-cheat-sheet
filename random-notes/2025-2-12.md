3. Cleaner Kotlin Code with Ktlint Gradle
    - ktlint is a Kotlin linter and code formatter developed by Pinterest.
    - Declare the ktlint-gradle plugin in the Version Catalog using the latest ktlint-gradle version
    - Next apply the ktlint-gradle plugin on your build.gradle.kts
    `alias(libs.plugins.ktlint.gradlew) apply false`
    - Then customize the plugin in your build.gradle.kts app file
    `ktlint {
    android.set(true) // Enable Android-specific linting rules
    ignoreFailures.set(true) // Prevents build from failing due to linting errors
    reporters {
    reporter(PLAIN) // Output KtLint results in plain text format
    reporter(HTML) // Output KtLint results in HTML format
    }
    }`
