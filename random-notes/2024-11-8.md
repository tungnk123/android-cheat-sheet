1. relationships between objects
    - Composition, Aggregation, and Association
    - Background services can outlive Activities/Fragments
2. Lifecycle-aware communication: LiveData, BroadcastReceivers that don't directly rely on the lifecycle of the Activity/Fragment
3. long-running task that persists even if the user navigates away from the Activity
Foreground Service:  requires user notification or ongoing interaction (like playing music)
WorkManager: scheduling and managing background work, ensuring tasks are executed even if the
app is closed or the device reboots
4. How can you handle errors in Kotlin Coroutines?
=> try/catch block; CoroutineExceptionHandler interface -> define a global handler for uncaught
exceptions within a coroutine scope
5. Coroutine jobs form a hierarchy where a parent coroutine can have multiple child coroutines
The parent job can be used to manage the lifecycle of its child jobs, ensuring that all child
coroutines are cancelled when the parent coroutine is cancelled
6. timeout for a coroutine:
withTimeout
withTimeOutOrNull
=> specify a maximum duration for the execution of a coroutine
=> coroutine will be cancelled if it exceeds that duration
7. How to share mutable state between coroutine safely in kotlin
=> use thread-safe data structures like Mutex or atomic operations provided by Atomic classes
=> or use coroutine channels to communicate and synchronize state changes
8. withtimeout in coroutine
access LifeCyclescope in fragment:
viewLifecycleOwner.lifecycleScope.launch {
// Coroutine code here
}
9. lifecycleOwner vs viewLifecycleOwner
scope: LifecycleOwner(fragment's entire lifycycle) vs viewLifeCycleOwner(fragment' view lifecycle)
lifecycleOwner: It is tied to the fragment itself, meaning it starts when the fragment is
created and ends when the fragment is destroyed.
viewLifecycleOwner becomes active when the Fragment’s view is created (onCreateView) and is
cleared when the view is destroyed (onDestroyView).
=> lifecycleOwner: Non-UI tasks, long-lived operations
=> viewLifecycleOwner: UI-related tasks, observers, coroutinesw
10. In an Activity, there is no separate viewLifecycleOwner like in a Fragment because the Activity’s viewlifecycle is managed by the Activity itself
