Coroutine vs Thread in Android:
	Coroutine:
		lightweight and can be launched by the hundreds or thousands without significant overhead
		programming model: cooperative multitasking model; where suspension points are explicitly defined, and 
			control is handed over between coroutines at those points
		built-in support for structured concurrency: allowing developers to scope and manage coroutines in a 
		hierarchical manner	
		=>  prevent resource leaks and ensures proper cleanup of resources when coroutines are cancelled or complete
	Thread:
		heavyweight operating system resources
		programming model: preemptive multitasking model, where the operating system scheduler decides when to 
		switch between threads
		=> unpredictable behavior and potential race conditions if not managed properly

Explain the benefits of using coroutines in Android development
	Easy asynchoronous programming
	concise and readable code: write asynchronous code in a sequential manner (compared to the traditional callback-based)
		by using suspending functions and structured concurrency
	Lightweight and Efficient
	Structured Concurrency
	Integration with Kotlin Language Features, Compatibility with Existing APIs

	
Coroutines in Kotlin are structured within coroutine scopes, which define the lifecycle and context in which coroutines are 
	executed
	manage the lifecycle of coroutines, including launching, canceling, and handling exceptions
	=> coroutines are properly cleaned up and resources are released when they are no longer needed, preventing memory 
		leaks and resource contention

Dispatchers.Unconfined ->  not recommended for use in Android development due to its unpredictable behavior


Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations.

Command pattern usecase:
	Undo / Redo Actions
	Device Control (Smart Home, Media Players, etc.)
	Managing API Requests (Queue-based API Calls): 
		Social Media Apps: Sending posts, comments, and likes
		E-commerce Apps: Submitting orders, fetching product data
	Managing Background Tasks (Download, Upload, Sync): Controls and executes task queues efficiently
	Macro Commands (Executing Multiple Actions at Once): 
		Executes multiple commands together
		Manages logic for grouped actions

Iterator pattern usecase:
	traverse over a list

Mediator usecase:
	Use the Mediator pattern when it’s hard to change some of the classes because they are tightly coupled to a bunch of 
		other classes.
	Use the pattern when you can’t reuse a component in a different program because it’s too dependent on other components.
	Use the Mediator when you find yourself creating tons of component subclasses just to reuse some basic behavior in 
		various contexts.
