1. Optimizing Kotlin Code: Performance Tips and Tricks
	Use `val` Instead of `var` Wherever Possible
	Leverage the Power of Inline Functions
	Be Mindful of Collection Operations
	Smart Casting over Manual Casting
	Utilize Lazy Initialization
	Prefer Structured Concurrency with Coroutines

	Proactive Resource Management
		Auto-closable resources: use 'use' block

2. Performance Optimization in Kotlin: Real-world Scenarios
	Scenario 1: Reducing Startup Time for a User-Focused App
	-> lazy, StartUp component

	Scenario 2: Streamlining Data-Intensive Operations
	-> use 'sequences'

	Scenario 3: Enhancing the Responsiveness of a High-Traffic Server Application
	-> kotlin coroutine, structured concurrency, ktor

3. Class order
	companion object
	@Inject
	
	override function
	private function

4. lifecycle.launch with lifecycle-aware guard
	continious collection outside of the UI active state
		waste resource doing work when the UI isn't visible
	null pointer exceptions
		lifecycleScope -> onDestroyViewed() -> no views but still collect data
	memory leaks
	duplicate or out-of-sync updates
