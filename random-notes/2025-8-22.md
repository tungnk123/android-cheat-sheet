The New Null Safety Mindset: Beyond Just Avoiding Crashes
	it's not just about preventing NullPointerExceptions — it's about creating self-documenting code that tells a story

	sealed class UserNameResult {
    		data class Success(val name: String) : UserNameResult()
    		object UserNotFound : UserNameResult()
    		object NameNotProvided : UserNameResult()
	}

	fun getUserName(): UserNameResult {
    		return when {
        		user == null -> UserNameResult.UserNotFound
        		user.name.isNullOrBlank() -> UserNameResult.NameNotProvided
        		else -> UserNameResult.Success(user.name)
    		}
	}

	=> Avoid using !! (not-null assertion operator) and use ? (nullable operator) sparingly.

API Design 101: From Basics to Best Practices
	API = define how software components should interact =  a contract
	What requests can be made (endpoints, methods, payloads)
	How to make those requests
	What responses to expect (status codes, response body)

	Core API styles:
		REST:
			Resourced: organized around resources using HTTP methods
			stateless	
			Standardized methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH
		=> Web and mobile apps
		GraphQL:
			Query Language: client requests exactly what they need
			single endpoint for all operations
			Operations: query (reed), mutation (write), subscription (real-time)
		=> Complex UI
		gRPC:
			Protocol Buffers: binary serialization with schema definition
			Service definition: methods defined as RPCs in .proto files
			Server streaming, client streaming, bidirectional streaming
		=> Microservices, high performance

	

Service crash:
	Why?
	call startForegroundService() in MainActivity and not call startForegound() within 5s
	=> startForeground must be called within 5s after startForegroundSerivce()
	=> call startForeground in onStartCommand()

A cold start happens when:
 	Your app process is not running at all, and
 	The system has to fully launch your app from scratch (load classes, initialize services, etc.)
	This is the slowest type of start — compared to:
 		Warm start: your app is in memory but paused
 		Hot start: your app was just backgrounded, and resumes instantly

Normal permissions
 	Auto-granted at install.
 	Low-risk (e.g. INTERNET, VIBRATE).
 	No runtime request needed.
Dangerous (Runtime) permissions ⚠️
 	Protect sensitive data (location, mic, camera, contacts, etc.)
 	Since Android 6.0 (API 23) → must ask at runtime (requestPermissions()).
 	Examples: RECORD_AUDIO, CAMERA, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, READ_CONTACTS.
Special permissions 🚨
 	Higher-level, not requested via requestPermissions() but via system Settings / dedicated APIs.
 	Examples: SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW, WRITE_SETTINGS, MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM. 
 	Some new ones (Android 13+): POST_NOTIFICATIONS.
=> Normar: auto-granted
=> Runtime: must request at runtime
=> special: need system settings
