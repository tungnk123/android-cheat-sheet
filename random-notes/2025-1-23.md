1. Advantages of using Usecases
    - Reusable, eliminate code duplication (boiterplate code): one Usecase for 2 ViewModel
    Easy to understand project
    - Simplify the ViewModel: Usecase do the business logic, ViewModel updates LiveData based on information retuned by UC
    - Reduce the project's dependency on the ViewModel: ViewModel has no direct access to Repository when we use Use Case
2. Domain layer being the core layer it should not know anything about other layers
=> So the transaformation of data dto to domain model should happen in the data layer
3. Separation of concerns
4. KISS, The Only Software Design Principle You Need
Keep it simple, stupid = Minimum Viable Product
=> Don't over-invest, Dont optimize prematurely; Keep focusing on what matters
starting with YAGNI, followed by KISS and landing on DRY
5. Modifier = class used to change the appearance and behavior of composables
6. Row and Column wrap their children size instead of fillMaxWidth()
7. Arrangement - main axis
Alignment - cross axis
8. fillMaxSize() vs matchParentSize()
    - fillMaxSize(): Does impact Box's final size
    - matchParentSize(): Doesn't impact Box's final size; only usable in Box
    => The size of the box will be measured by other children element of the box. Then the element with the Modifier.matchParentSize() will match and occupy that size.
9. **Modifier Scope safety**
interface BoxScope {
    fun Modifier.matchParentSize()	
}
=> can only use matchParentSize() in a Box, not a Column or Row
interface RowScope {
    fun Modifier.weight()
}
=> can only use weight() in a Row or a Column, not a Box
10. Compose Phase = Composition(What) + Layout(Where) + Drawing(Drawing)
    - Composition: transfer composables into Layout Tree, each Composable is a Layout Node
    - Layout: LayoutTree -> define each node size and location in 2D space
        - Measure chilren
        - Decide own size
        - Place childern
        => Each node is visited only one
    - Drawing:
11. Modifiers wrap a single Modifier or layout node
