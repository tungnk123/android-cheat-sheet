Code Review for Mobile Apps
	Step 1: Create Platform-Specific Review Checklists -> PR template
	Step 2: Make Review a Two-Way Conversation -> Describe what changed, how to test?
	Step 3: Automate the basics to humans can focus -> use Lint, CI/CD to tests
	Step 4: Always Review UI with Your Eyes (and Fingers) -> run the app: responsive? dark mode ? accessibilty ?
	Step 5: Train Eyes for the "Silent Killers" -> memory leaks, try/catch, ...
	Step 6: Assign ownership without creating bottlenecks
		-> Assign review owners per module (e.g., auth, profile, media)
		-> Use CODEOWNERS file in GitHub
		-> Rotate reviewers so knowledge spreads
		-> Have review dashboards (track PR age, review load)
