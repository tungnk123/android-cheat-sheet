ANR:

		excessive UI work during layout or drawing
	Mitigation:
		Use Coroutines or Executor for background tasks
		Offload heavy work to background threads
		optimize UI rendering and layout

	
Layout performance:
	Deeply nested layouts
	Overdraw drawing the same pixels multiple times
	Unnecessary layout passes
	=> Use ConstraintLayout, Use the LayoutInspector to identify overdraw
