1. Google Just Gave Android Developers Superpowers — Here’s How I’m Using Them
	- GenAI in ML Kit = it’s basically a lightweight, local-first way to add AI magic to your apps
	- No server setup. No Firebase ML custom models. No OpenAI tokens. Just install the right dependency and boom — you can summarise text, proofread it, rewrite it in a different tone, or even generate descriptions from images. Locally. On Android.
	- **Free**
	- **Privacy-friendly** (everything runs on-device)
	- **Simple** to use, with Android-friendly APIs
	- And… it makes your app feel **incredibly smart**
2. Youtube data API
	- Free
	- 10000 quote/day
	- Search: 100 quote
	- Not good -> Server for cache, 3-party, internal API or Web Search JSON
	- SoundCloud API
