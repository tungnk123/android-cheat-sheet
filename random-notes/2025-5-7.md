1. Kotlin’s Hidden Powers
	1. Reified Type Parameters — Type-safe Reflection
		inline fun <reified T> Gson.fromJson(json: String): T = 
    			this.fromJson(json, T::class.java)
	-> Perfect for generic deserialization, type-safe factory methods, and removing boilerplate like manually passing Class<T> to 
		functions (You can access the type T at runtime. No more passing Class<T> manually.)

	2. Contracts API (Experimental, but powerful!)
	-> contract { returns() implies (value != null) }
	=> Enables the compiler to understand custom smart casts.

	3. Delegated Properties (Beyond lazy)
	-> Lazily loading expensive computations only when needed. Perfect for large objects, config files, or expensive initialization.

	4. Type-safe Builders / DSLs
	-> building structured documents, UI hierarchies, or complex configuration files

	5. Extension Functions: Too Much of a Good Thing

	6. Context Receivers (K2 Compiler Feature)
		context(UserContext)
		fun greet()
	-> A cleaner alternative to dependency injection or implicit scope sharing

	7. The Nothing Type: fun fail(message: String): Nothing = throw IllegalStateException(message)
	-> Declare that a function will never return; useful in functions that always throw, loop infinitely, or call exitProcess()

	8. Infix Functions for Fluent APIs

2. Espresso for UI testing: 
	@Test
	fun testLoginButton() {
    		onView(withId(R.id.loginButton)).perform(click())
    		onView(withId(R.id.resultText)).check(matches(isDisplayed()))
	}

3. Timber (Logging Utility)
	Timber.plant(Timber.DebugTree())
	Timber.d("User clicked item with id=%s", itemId)
	
	-> Automatically tags with class name, cleaner syntax
	Can be disabled or customized in release builds (Logs remain in release builds unless manually removed or stripped via ProGuard 
		rules)
	Easier to extend with custom behavior (e.g., crash reporting) (like sending errors to Crashlytics or logging to a file)
	Logs remain in release builds unless manually removed or stripped via ProGuard rules
	Cleaner syntax with built-in string formatting.
	Lint checks improve code quality.
