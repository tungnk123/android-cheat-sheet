1. Delegated properties
= property whose getter and optional setter implementations are provided by an external object called the delegate
=> reusable custom property implementations
The delegate object has to implement an operator getValue() function, as well as a setValue() function
2. Generic delegates:
The delegate functions can be declared in a generic way, so the same delegate class can be used with various
property types
3. For delegated properties of non-null primitive types, prefer using specialized delegate classes created for that specific
value type rather than a generic delegate, to avoid boxing overhead during each access to the property
4. Standard delegates: lazy()
    - a function returning a delegate for read-only properties that will evaluate the provided lambda to initialize the property value when first read
    => Use the lazy() delegate to defer expensive initializations, and specify the thread safety mode to avoid locking when itâ€™s not needed
    - by lazy(LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE)
    LazyThreadSafetyMode.SYNCHRONIZED
5. SharedPreferences -> user preferences, settings, and session information
    - SharedPreferences vs DataStore:
    - SharedPreferences: Key-Value XML Storage; Not thread-safe (synchronous I/O); Slower (writes block UI thread);
    Supports only primitive data types
    - DataStore: Jetpack Library (Proto or Preferences);
    Thread-safe (uses Coroutines)
    Faster (async, non-blocking)
    More secure (encrypted support with Proto DataStore)
    Can handle complex data objects through serialization
    offers observability through Flow or LiveData
    => DataStore: better performance, thread safety, security; handle complex objects
6. TypeSafety in Android:
    - TypeSafety = ensures that variables hold only the intended data types at compile-time, preventing runtime errors
    - Strongly Typed: Variables have a defined type and cannot hold different types.
    - Nullable & Non-Nullable Types: Prevents null pointer exceptions.
    - Smart Casting: Automatically casts a variable if checked before.
    - Sealed Classes & Enums: Ensures restricted and predictable type hierarchies.
    - Generics: Type-safe data structures.
    - Type Inference: Compiler auto-detects variable types.
    - DataStore with Proto Buffers: Ensures type-safe key-value storage.
7. Int.minutes -> Returns a Duration equal to this Int number of minutes.
8. MediaLibraryService = MediaSessionService + LibraryManagement
    - MediaLiraryService: Supports Browsing; Supports Search (Google Assistant, Android Auto); Supports Android Auto, Google Assistant
    Provides MediaItem Lists
    => Provides Media Browsing Capabilities; Supports Android Auto & Google Assistant
    Enables In-App Search; Integrates with Other Media Apps
    - => Allow users to browse media outside the app; Search for media via Google Assistant
9. Why just full nullable type? -> Nullable type are reference type -> Object -> Boxing and Unboxing overhead performance
