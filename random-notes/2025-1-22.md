3. MediaSessionService vs ForegroundService
MediaSessionService in Media3 Exoplayer: designed for handling media playback in Android and works seamlessly
with the Android media framework; design for media playback;
support LockScreen controls, bluetooth/heaset,
built-in Notification
Manage Playback state via MediaSession API
External Devices
Advanced playback features like playlists or media browsing
ForegroundService: running tasks that must keep running even when the app is not visible, often with a
persistent notification.
Control Over Service Lifecycle: You have full control over the lifecycle of the service.
Custom Implementation: You can design it to handle tasks other than media playback if needed.
Persistent Notification: Ensures the service is running by displaying a notification that cannot be dismissed.
use startForeground()
=> MediaSessionService: Full integration with system UI; Supports built-in media controls; Specialized for media playback,
managing sessions seamlessly.
4. Future and ListenableFuture
constructs used for handling asynchronous tasks, often to manage the results of operations that may not complete
immediately
=> Move to use Kotlin Coroutine
MediaController = A controller that interacts with a MediaSession, a MediaSessionService hosting a MediaSession,
or a MediaLibraryService hosting a MediaLibraryService.
5. Media3 ExoPlayer components:
ExoPlayer = A robust media player that supports various formats (HLS, DASH, MP4, MP3, etc.) and advanced features
like adaptive streaming and DRM.
MediaSession: A bridge between the media player (ExoPlayer) and the Android system. It enables handling media
controls from system UI components (e.g., lock screen, notifications, and Bluetooth devices).
=> It manages playback states and metadata for interaction with the system and external controllers
MediaSessionService: A service that hosts a MediaSession and handles the lifecycle of playback in the background.
It's ideal for apps requiring persistent media playback.
MediaController: A client-side API for controlling media playback remotely via a MediaSession.
It allows user interfaces and external components to control playback.
=> Sends commands like play, pause, or seek to the MediaSession
=> Receives updates on playback state and metadata from the MediaSession.

=> ExoPlayer handles the actual media playback
6. Player provides the interface for controlling playback and accessing its state

7. MediaSession bridges the player with the system, allowing interaction with system UI and external devices.
8. MediaSessionService ensures that the media session and playback are managed persistently in the background.
MediaController connects to the media session and provides a way for UI or external devices to control playback remotely.
9. Player = core engine that actually plays the media
MediaSession = middleman translate commands from the system-level components (Notification, lock screen, extrenal devices
like Bluetooth, Android Auto) or a MediaController into actions on the Player
MediaController = remote controller for the MediaSession; Sends commands like play, pause, stop, or seek to the
MediaSession, which then forwards them to the Player.
10. MediaSessionService = Manages the MediaSession in the background; Ensures that the MediaSession and the Player are alive
even when the app is not in the foreground
11. How to Work with Player
Direct Commands via Player: player.play(), player.pause(), player.seekTo()
Using MediaController: control playback remotely
12. MediaController abstracts the communication with the MediaSession, allowing UI or external devices to issue playback
commands without directly managing the session or player.
13. User presses "Play" on the app's UI → App uses MediaController.play() → Command is sent to MediaSession → MediaSession calls Player.play() → Playback starts.
