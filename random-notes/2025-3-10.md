1. 5 Must-Know Kotlin Performance Tips
	- Use inline for High-Order Functions to Reduce Overhead
		Use inline when:		
		You have a small function with lambda parameters
		You want to reduce function call overhead
		You are using generics and need type information at runtime (reified)
		Avoid inline when:
		The function body is too large (code duplication increases binary size)
		The function is called infrequently (no performance benefit)
		The function doesnâ€™t take lambda parameters (no need for inlining)
	-> small high-order functions with lambda parameters that is called frequently
	
	- Use lazy for Expensive Property Initialisation
	- Use copy() for Data Classes Instead of Creating New Objects
	- Use operator fun invoke() for Cleaner Code and Faster Calls
	- Use const val Instead of val for Compile-Time Constants
