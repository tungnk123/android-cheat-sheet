1. auto click, auto fill app use AccessibilityService
2. Delegation is an extreme example of object composition.
3. class inheritance vs object composition vs delegation

4. Common usecase pattern mistakes	
UseCases = containter that hold specific tasks or operations your app need to perform
each UseCase should do one thing and do it well
Usecase benefits = Promotes code reusability, Separates business logic, Improves testability,
Enables modular architecture
5. 2 common usecase mistakes:
	Enforcing strict ViewModel-to-UseCase-only access -> keep it optional
	Exp: if a Repository has 10 methods, you end up creating 10 corresponding UseCases
	=>  injecting a single repository would be more efficient
	Creating one-to-one mappings between Repository methods and UseCases ->  direct repository access
		from the ViewModel

=> A good approach is to add use cases only when required
=> when thereâ€™s complex business logic that needs to be encapsulated, not as a mandatory layer between
6. ViewModels and Repositories
=> encapsulating complex business logic (usecase combine from multiple repository)
7. Run benchmark to check performance
FlowMVI library in Github
system of plugin -> form a chain of responsibility and intercept any incoming and outgoing events
Configuring Dependabot security updates
8. github tool for open source
    - coderabbitai -> auto code review, ai
    - codacy -> check code quality
    - Dependabot -> configurating security updates
    - Renovate -> Automated Dependency Updates
