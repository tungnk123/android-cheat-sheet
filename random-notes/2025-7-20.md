Question 2: When a data class breaks equals and hashCode because of var
	Kotlin generates equals(), hashCode(), and copy() based on all properties in the primary constructor — regardless of whether they 
		are val or var.

	If you change a var after construction, hashCode() may change while the object is already used as a key in a hash-based collection. 
	=> This leads to inconsistent behavior and makes the object effectively unfindable.

	Avoid declaring var properties in the primary constructor of a data class if instances will be used in maps, sets, or caches.

	Instead, make them immutable (val), or move mutability into the class body
		data class Person(val id: Int, val name: String) {
    			var isMarried: Boolean = false
		}

	Using var in the constructor of a data class can also lead to issues in Jetpack Compose — especially when working with remember, 
		derivedStateOf, or other recomposition-sensitive APIs.
