1. You Can Make Money With AI Without Quitting Your Job -> 2 hour a day
	Every day, after work, I sit down for 2 hours.
	No scrolling. No Netflix. Just pure focus.

	You’re already wasting time by not trying.
	=> pick a industry -> package a service -> help people do something -> offer

2. Kotlin DSL -> Kotlin Domain Specific Language
	Kotlin code written in a specific way to make it:
		Look like a custom language, tailored to a specific domain (e.g., HTML, Gradle, UI)
		Readable and declarative, like a configuration file
		Type-safe, because it's still Kotlin under the hood

	Use Kotlin features like: lambdas with receiver, extension functions, default & named arguments, infix functions
	-> Gradle Kotlin DSL, Jetpack Compose, Ktor routes, Kotlinx.html

	=> Kotlin DSL is a style of writing Kotlin that makes your code feel like a mini-language tailored to a specific task — 
		clean, readable, and domain-focused.

	Exp:
		Gradle Kotlin DSL (build.gradle.kts)
		Jetpack Compose – UI DSL
		Ktor Routing DSL – Web server: routing {get {}}
		Koin DSL – Dependency Injection
		HTML Builder DSL

3. Practical strategies to improve Gradle build performance in Android projects using Kotlin
	Clean build vs Incremental build 
	Create Benchmarks: Track both clean builds (after clearing the Gradle cache) and incremental builds
	Update Everything: Gradle, Kotlin, the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP), and even Java itself all receive regular updates that 
		include not just new features, but meaningful performance improvements under the hood.

	Optimize gradle.properties: 
		JVM Memory Settings
		Enable Gradle Caching: org.gradle.caching=true
		Parallel Build Execution: org.gradle.parallel=true
		Configure on Demand: org.gradle.configureondemand=true
			Gradle daemon =  background process that keeps running between builds to speed things up.
			Gradle has to start a new JVM process every time you build — slow.
			-> Gradle reuses the same JVM, so builds are much faster, especially for repeated builds.
		-> only configure the projects that are necessary for the current build -> reduce configuration overhead
		Maximize Gradle Daemon Use: org.gradle.daemon=true
		-> By enabling the Gradle daemon, you keep the process running between builds, avoiding the startup time required 
			for each build
		Keep the Build Log Clean: org.gradle.logging.level=info
		-> Gradle only logs essential information during the build
	Avoid dynamic depdendency

	Optimize Dependency Resolution:
		Avoid Unnecessary and Unused Dependencies -> use Lint to check
		Optimize Repository Order:
			Gradle resolves dependencies by searching through the repositories in the order they are declared
			-> Prioritize repositories -> mavenCentral() -> google() -> maven

	while Groovy is faster, Kotlin DSL is perfect for those who prioritize long-term code quality and tooling

	gradle build --scan -> check 

4. findViewById() is NULLABLE -> must handle null properly

5. for vs forEach
	for:
		need break/ continue
		more verbose
	forEach: 
		concise
		slightly slower (use lambda -> lambda overhead, lambda object)
