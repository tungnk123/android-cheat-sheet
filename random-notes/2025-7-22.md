Gradle supports the usage of dependencies only for specific build types
	testImplementation()
	debugImplementation()
	releaseImplementation()

Dispatcher.Main vs Dispatcher.Main.immediate
	Dispatcher.Main:
		Always schedules your block through a Handler
		Always posts a message to Main looper: evens if you are already on the UI thread -> code run in the next loop/frame
	Dispactcher.Main.immediate:
		Run the blocks immediately if you are already on the UI thread and the coroutine hasn't been suspended; otherwise falls back
		to Main
		Post only when you are NOT on the UI thread
=> Main: need to yield the next frame 
=> Main.immediate: small, quick, operations that may be called very often on the UI thread and not add queue overhead (chart redraw)
