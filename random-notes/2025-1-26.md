support multiple languages, cultures, and regions without requiring changes in the source code

Using resource files: organizing translation files into different res/values
4. emit() vs tryEmit():
    - emit(): suspend function; used with Flow or StateFlow; return Unit
    => Use in suspending context
    - tryEmit(): non-suspending function; used with StateFlow and SharedFlow;  attempts to emit a value immediately
    	without suspending; return Boolean (true if emission succeeds)
    => emit values immediately without suspending or waiting
5. Dependency Injection in Compose
    - Dependency injection = a programming pattern which prescribes that classes do not construct instances of their dependencies instead such instances are provided
    => seperation of concerns, testability, reusability, ease of maintainance
6. Hilt provide 2 features:
    - Providing dependencies: how objects and their dependencies are constructed and acquired by classes that need them.
    - Scoping dependencies: defining where objects are retained and the lifetime in which those objects are valid.
    - Recommended approach: Use a ViewModel and inject your dependencies there through the constructor instead of injecting in Activity
    NOTE: If PaymentApi needs to be constructed with an Activity instance, a ViewModel holding on to that dependency
    will leak the old Activity after a configuration change.
    => fall back to injecting into the framework class
