1. Cancellation in coroutines
	Cancelling the scope cancels its children
	A cancelled child doesn’t affect other siblings
	
	Once you cancel a scope, you won’t be able to launch new coroutines in the cancelled scope.
	Cancellation of coroutine code needs to be cooperative!

	Making your coroutine work cancellable
	Checking for job’s active state: isActive and ensureActive()

	A coroutine in the cancelling state is not able to suspend!
