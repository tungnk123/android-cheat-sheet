Can you make a Flow behave like LiveData?
	Both Flow and LiveData deliver observable data from a ViewModel to the UI.

	By default, Flow is cold and lazy. But once you turn it into a StateFlow using stateIn(), it becomes hot — and unless you configure 
	it carefully, it may start collecting immediately and never stop.

	LiveData starts and stops automatically based on active observers. StateFlow, on the other hand, keeps collecting as long as its 
	scope is active — even if no one is reading its .value.

	LiveData starts/stops automatically — StateFlow doesn't, unless you use SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed()
	stateIn(..., Eagerly) → always running
	stateIn(..., Lazily) → starts once, never stops
	stateIn(..., WhileSubscribed()) → starts/stops based on active collectors

	collectWithLifecycle() ensures your collector follows the UI lifecycle — for example, stopping when the composable leaves the screen.

	If you're collecting from a StateFlow created with SharingStarted.Eagerly, the flow has already started. 
	collectWithLifecycle() simply controls whether the UI receives updates — not whether the flow is running.


	To truly mimic LiveData behavior:
		Use stateIn(..., WhileSubscribed()) in the ViewModel
		Use collectWithLifecycle() in the Composable
