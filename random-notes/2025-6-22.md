Coding Was Hard Until I Learned These 7 Things
	1. Don’t Memorize
		Focus more on the logic and the problem instead of the syntax
		
	2. Read Error Messages
	3. Break Things Down
		I learned how to break things into small, small pieces.
		
	4. Focus On One Thing
		
	5. Build Projects You Actually Care About
		
	6. Ask Questions
		
	7. Take Breaks
		Burnout is real, my people! Burnout is real.
		If you’re doing something that is not working out for a very long time, especially when you are doing late-night coding 
		sessions, if something is apparently not working out — take a break.
