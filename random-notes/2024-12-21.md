1. apk vs aab
apk = Android Packing Kit = traditional, simple, but can lead to larger download sizes since they include resources
for all device configuration
aab = Android App Bundle = package their app in a way that Google play can optimize for each device configuration,
-> delivering only the necessary code and resources.
=> smaller app size, support features like dynamic delivery and on-demand resources
2. deobfuscate stack traces from release builds.
3. KSP = Kotlin Symbol Processing
4. Version catalog
5. The Navigation Component enables developers to define all app navigation in a single navigation graph XML file
Destination = activities and fragments
Action = connections between screens
6. The Navigation Component simplifies fragment transactions by automatically handling many complexities of fragment
management, such as back-stack handling and lifecycle awareness
=> use NavController to navigate instead of FragmentManager
7. Safe Args vs implicit intents
Safe Args = part of Navigation component -> facilitate safe and type-checked data passing between destinations
defined in a navigation graph
=> generate arguments for each destination, pass data using strongly typed methods
=> reduce the risk of runtime errors
    
    Implicit intents = intents used to request actions from another componens without specifying the exact component
