1. How do you decide between MVVM and MVI?
	MVVM:
		The View observes the ViewModel.
		Data flows both ways (View ↔ ViewModel).
		State can be more loosely managed.
	=> 	Your app is UI-driven with simpler state.
		You need two-way data binding or easy form validation.
		You want to stick with Jetpack best practices.
		Your team is familiar with LiveData, ViewModel, etc.
		You don’t need full-blown unidirectional state management.

	MVI:
		One-way data flow (Intent → Model → View).
		Emphasizes immutable state and pure functions.
		State management is strict and centralized.
	=> 	You have complex UI states and need strict state control.
		You want a single source of truth for the UI state.
		You're building something reactive with clear side effects (e.g., chat, streams, games).
		You want predictable behavior and easier time-travel debugging.
	=> Chat apps, real-time dashboard, apps with heavy user interaction, app using Jetpack Compose

=> Ask yourself:

	Is state complexity a concern? → Go MVI.
	Do I just need to hook UI to data with minimal overhead? → Go MVVM.
	Using Compose and love state containers? → MVI shines here.

2. How to build a scalable user authentication flow?
	1. Auth Strategy
		Start with: Email/Password
		Expand later: Google, Facebook, OTP, Passwordless
		Add 2FA/MFA for security if needed
	 2. Backend
		Core APIs: /register, /login, /logout, /me, /refresh
		Use JWT + Refresh Tokens
		Security Tips: Hash passwords, use HTTPS, Limit failed login attempts
	3. Frontend
		Store access token in memory or ViewModel
		Store refresh token in EncryptedSharedPrefs or DataStore
		Auto-refresh token on 401 response
		Redirect to login if refresh fails
	4.  Architecture
		Use MVVM or MVI
		Create AuthRepository to handle logic
		Manage UI state with a sealed class
	5.  Edge Case Handling
		Token expiration
		No internet
		User banned or deactivated
		Forgot password / Email not verified
	6.  Extendability
		Add social login
		Support multiple devices
		Role-based access control (admin, user, etc.)

3. Generic in Kotlin for duplicate code

4. nly update data if currentIndex != newIndex
