1. ImageVector vs XML drawable, a performance guide
	- Icons.Default.<ICON_NAME> under the hood
	- **Step**: 1. Parsing the XML, 2. Vector Drawable Creation, 3. View Measurement and Layout, 4. Canvas Drawing, 5. Path Processing and Rendering, 6. Painting
	- PathBuilder: which stored paths needed for drawing the vector asset as constants in the code
	- parsing and showing a vector drawable that is stored in the code would **cost less** since it does not need to read and parse the XML (step 1) and also creating the `ImageVector` would take less time due to the decreased overhead as a result of the drawable being stored in a **Kotlin file** which will later be **compiled** into the **binaries**
	- the SVGs which were converted to `ImageVector` being a little faster in terms of **render time**
2. `**ContentObserver**` **does NOT trigger on permission grant**

	→ It only fires when call log data changes (new call, delete, update).
	
	**Derived** `**StateFlow**` **is read-only**
	
	→ Never assign `.value` to flows created via `stateIn()`.


3. Resize app icon on figma
	- 1024 -> 512
	- Use 0.5x dimension
4. Use wine for run windows app in Linux
