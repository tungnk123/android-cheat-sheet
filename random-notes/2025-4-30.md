1. How Senior Engineers Think Differently: 10 Mental Models You Need
	A senior engineer doesn’t just solve problems — they prevent them.
	A senior engineer doesn’t just write code — they design systems.
	A senior engineer doesn’t just work on tickets — they understand business impact.

	It takes years of experience, countless mistakes, and HARD lessons learned the HARD way.
	The more senior you become, the calmer you get.

	Number 1:
		🔴 Junior: “How do I write this?”
		🟢 Senior: "Why I write this at all?”
	=> Spending more time on impact analysis is way more important than breaking your head over writing code.
	
	Number 2:
		🔴 Junior: “I need to fix this bug ASAP.”
		🟢 Senior: “Why did this bug happen in the first place?”
	=> They spend more time thinking about the side effects rather than just the fix.
	=> RCA = Root Cause Analysis

	Number 3:
		🔴 Junior: “The code works, so I’m done.”
		🟢 Senior: “Is this code maintainable for the long run?”	
	=> “Once you raise the PR and hand it off to QA, take a step back.
	Read your own code. Ask yourself — can this be made better in any way?”

	=> Boy Scout Rule: Leave the code better than you found it.

	Number 4:
		🔴 Junior: “I can solve this.”
		🟢 Senior: “How can the team solve this together?”
	=> A senior engineer doesn’t just solve problems; they create solutions that others can understand, maintain, and build upon.
	=> Writing clear documentation; Sharing knowledge in team discussions; Asking, “How can we make this scalable for the whole 
		team?”

	Number 5:
		🔴 Junior: “I need to learn X.”
		🟢 Senior: “I first need to learn how to learn.”
	=> The best engineers aren’t the ones who know the most—they’re the ones who can learn the fastest.
	=> They focused on fundamentals; They didn’t memorize things; They understood that technology will change, but core principles 
		stay the same.
