Exploring 5 Lesser-Known Compose Components
	1. TriStateCheckbox
		TriStateCheckbox adds a third state: indeterminate. It represents a state when something is either not fully checked or 
		not fully unchecked.
		
	2. SegmentedButton
		A segmented button is a button that supports selection between two to five options. It can contain icons, text, or both.
		There are two variants of the segmented button: single-choice and multi-choice. 
		They are implemented as different components.
	=> Single choice segmented button, multitple choice

	3. RangeSlider: 2 value
	4. Badge
		A badge represents a notification and is meant to draw attention to an element and notify the user that there are 
		pending requests or actions.

		A BadgedBox is a component that wraps the component to which we want to anchor the badge.

SAF, Scoped storage:
	Refers to shared storage (e.g., /storage/emulated/0/).
	Before Android 10 → apps could freely read/write with permissions:
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
	From Android 10+ (Scoped Storage) → access is restricted:
	Apps can freely use only their own app-specific folder (/Android/data/<package>/files/…).
	For other files → must use SAF or MediaStore.
