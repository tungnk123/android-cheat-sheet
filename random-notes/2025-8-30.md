Fundamentals of functional programming
	OOP = classes + attributes + methods + reelations
	FP = immutable data + functions + composition

	Pure function = function given the same input a function will always return the same output

	Side effect = reading variables outside the function scope (global variables)
		querying a database
		reading a file
		calling an API
		logging
	
	Immutable variables -> create a new one with copy 
	
	First-class functions = functions are like variables
		Functions are not attached to classes, but they are first-class citizens of the language
		You can declare them anywhere, pass them as arguments and return functions as the return value of function
	=> make your code declarative
