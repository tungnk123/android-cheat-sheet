1. WorkManager is an Android library designed to handle background tasks that need to be **guaranteed** to run, even if the app is **closed** or the device is **restarted**
=> managing persistent, deferrable, and guaranteed background task in andriod
    - **tasks** can be set up to run only **under specific conditions**, suchas when the divice is connected to wifi, has sufficent battery level or is charing
    - **Automatically retries** tasks if they fail, based on exponential backoff.
    - Supports **chaining** and **combining** multiple tasks with dependencies.
    - You can **schedule one-off** or **repeating** tasks.
2. WorkManager vs JobScheduler vs AlarmManager
    - WorkManager = Used for deferrable, guaranteed background tasks that need to complete even if the app or device restarts
    - JobSchedule = Schedules jobs to be run at a later time or under certain conditions
    - AlarmManager = Used to trigger actions at exact times or after a specific duration
    => tasks that need to be triggered at a specific time or interval
