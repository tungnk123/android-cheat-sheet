2. In Kotlin, as in many other languages, memory is split into two main parts: the stack and the heap.
3. Stack Memory vs Heap Memory
    - Stack Memory:
        - local variables, references, function calls
        - very fast
        - smaller
        - automatic
        - Acesss Pattern: LIFO
        => for primitive data types, references, function calls
    - Heap Memory:
        - objects, arrays and class instances
        - slower
        - larger
        - managed by garbage collector
        - Access pattern: Random access
        - For dynamic object creation
