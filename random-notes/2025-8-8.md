Transition to using 16 KB page sizes for Android apps and games using Android Studio
	Android is transitioning from 4 KB to 16 KB memory page sizes for better performance.
	Starting Nov 1, 2025, all new apps and updates with native C/C++ code targeting Android 15+ must support 16 KB page 
		sizes on Google Play.

	Why it matters:
		Devices with 16 KB page size see:
		5–10% overall performance boost
		Up to 30% faster app launch
		4.56% battery improvement
		Faster camera start & boot times

	Who is affected?
		Apps using native code (NDK or native SDKs) must recompile and ensure 16 KB compatibility.
		Apps built with only Kotlin/Java are already compatible.

	How to prepare:
		Use Android Studio tools:
			APK Analyzer: Check for .so files and 16 KB compatibility.
			Lint & Alignment Checks: Get warnings for non-compliant native libraries.
		Upgrade tools:
			Use AGP 8.5.1+ and NDK r28+ to enable 16 KB alignment.
		Fix code:
			Replace hardcoded 4096 (4 KB) with getpagesize() or sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE).
		Test on 16 KB environments:
			Use Android Emulator with 16 KB support.
			Test on real devices like Pixel 8+ with Android 15+.


Callback → Coroutine-friendly means wrapping a callback-based async API so it can be used as a suspend function:
 	Callback API: Starts work, returns immediately, delivers result later via a method like onSuccess()/onError().
	 Problem: You can’t write sequential code (val result = foo()) because the result isn’t returned directly.
	 Coroutine-friendly API: A suspend function that pauses until the result is ready, then resumes, without blocking the thread.
suspendCancellableCoroutine is the standard Kotlin tool for this:
	Suspend the coroutine at the call site.
	Start the async work.
	Call resume() inside the callback to continue the coroutine with the result.
	Optionally handle cancellation with invokeOnCancellation.
Benefits:
 	Sequential, readable code.
 	No thread blocking.
 	Supports cancellation and cleanup.
