1. **Stop Freezing Your Users: A Real-World Guide to Multithreading in Android**
	- In one of my early projects, I thought I was clever enough to download and parse a giant JSON file… directly in `onCreate()`.
	- Threads & Executors (Old School): 
		- Works, but you have to handle lifecycle cleanup yourself.
		- If Activity is gone, this thread keeps running = 💣 memory leak.
	- AsyncTask (RIP)
		- Looked neat back then, but if Activity dies → leak.
		- Deprecated for good reason.
	- RxJava (Reactive Era)
		- Super powerful for streams/events.
		- But… forget to `dispose()` when Activity dies → 💥 memory leak.
	- Coroutines (The New Standard)
		- No leaks — cancels automatically with `ViewModel`.
		- Much less boilerplate.
		- My go‑to today.
	- Mistakes I’ve Made (So You Don’t Have To)
		- ❌ Left a `Thread` running when Fragment destroyed → leak
		- ❌ Ran DB queries on main thread → ANR
		- ❌ Forgot to cancel Rx subscriptions → crash after navigation
		=> Get data in IO thread, update UI (adapter) in Main thread
	- Tools:
		- **LeakCanary** — shows if you leaked that Activity.
		- **StrictMode** — yells when you do DB/Network on main thread.

2. **GraphQL in Android**
	- You get **exactly what you ask for.**
	- GraphQL uses a **single endpoint** to fetch exactly what you need in a single request.
	- It lets clients (your Android app) request exactly the data they need, nothing more, nothing less.
	- Key Advantages:
		- Fetch only what you need: Avoid over-fetching or under-fetching data.
		- Single endpoint: Simplifies server communication.
		- Strongly typed schema: Backend defines exactly what queries are allowed.
		- Real-time support: With subscriptions, you can get live updates.
	- Basic Concepts of GraphQL
		- **Query**: Read or fetch data.
		- **Mutation**: Create, update, or delete data.
		- **Subscription**: Listen to real-time data changes (like notifications).
	- Use **Apollo** Kotlin
		- Apollo generates Kotlin models from GraphQL queries, giving you typesafe code and easy integration
