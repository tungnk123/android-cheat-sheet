The Android Developer's Dilemma: Why 73% Choose Retrofit Over Ktor (And When They Shouldn't)
	Retrofit: it's heavily tied to the Android/JVM ecosystem
	=> Not KMP

	Ktor: pure Kotlin networking that works everywhere. 
	No Java baggage, no Android assumptions — just clean, coroutines-first networking.

	Bundle size: Ktor client is lighter (~2MB vs Retrofit's ~3MB+ with dependencies)
	Startup time: Retrofit's reflection-heavy approach has a slight cold-start penalty
	Memory usage: Ktor's coroutines-first design uses memory more efficiently

	Retrofit Usecase:
		Your team is primarily Android-focused and multiplatform isn't on the roadmap
		You need extensive third-party integration (OkHttp interceptors, Moshi converters, etc.)
		Junior developers make up most of your team — Retrofit's annotations are more beginner-friendly
		Tight deadlines mean you can't afford to debug multiplatform networking quirks
	Ktor usecase: 
		Multiplatform development is part of your strategy (even if not immediate)
		Your team loves Kotlin and wants to avoid Java-legacy patterns
		You're building from scratch and don't need extensive third-party ecosystem support
		Performance optimization and memory efficiency are critical
