1. Android Developer Roadmap in 2026
	- Android apps now run on compact phones, large phones, foldables that open like books, flip phones that change size mid-use, tablets, Chromebooks, car dashboards, televisions, and devices that show the same app across multiple displays at once.
	- Native Android makes sense for products that care deeply about **performance, stability, accessibility, system-level integration, and long-term scalability.**
	- Teams expect developers to understand data flow, separation of responsibilities, testability, and how to evolve an architecture as requirements grow.
	- Handling multiple screen sizes is no longer an advanced topic. It’s a baseline expectation.
2. **Designing Great Android Apps for Tablets**
- Use a Flexible Layout: ConstraintLayout, Linear Layout
- Provide multiple layouts for different screens
- Understanding screen density:
	- pixel: fixed
	- dpi = dot per inch
	- dp = density independent pixels -> system auto scales the dp units based on the actual pixel density
	- base: 160 dpi = medium density -> 1dp = 1 pixel
	- 320 dpi screen: 1 dp = 2 pixel
- Using qualifiers:
	- Smallest screen width qualifier: sw800dp
	- Tablet: 7 inch -> sw600dp
	- Tablet: 10 inch -> sw800dp
