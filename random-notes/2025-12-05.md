1. What is flatMapLatest, debounce, and conflate in Flow? Why do they matter?
	- **flatMapLatest:** When upstream emits new value, cancels the previous inner flow and switches to the latest. Great for search-as-you-type.
	- **debounce:** Waits for a pause in emissions. Useful to avoid handling every keystroke; only act after user stops typing for X ms.
	- **conflate:** If the collector is slow, `conflate` drops intermediate values and keeps the latest — avoids backlog.
	- **Why they matter:** They help manage rapid streams, reduce unnecessary work, avoid overloading network/db, and provide the UX you expect.
	- **Real-world use:** Search box input — use `debounce` + `flatMapLatest` to only run the latest query after user pauses, canceling previous network calls.
	- searchText .debounce(300) // wait 300ms after typing stops
		.distinctUntilChanged() 
		.flatMapLatest { query -> flow { emit(api.search(query)) } // previous search canceled automatically }
