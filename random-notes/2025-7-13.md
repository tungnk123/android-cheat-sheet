What is System Design in Android? — The Beginner’s Guide for Mobile Engineers
	System design in Android is the practice of architecting your mobile app’s components and workflows to ensure:
		Scalability; Performance; Maintainability; Testability; Separation of Concerns

	App Architecture: 
		MVP, MVVM, MVI
		Clean Architecture: UI → Domain → Data layers
	State Management
		Jetpack Compose state, ViewModel, flows, LiveData
		Hoisting and unidirectional data flow
	Data Layer Design
		Repository pattern
		Caching strategies (memory, disk, Room DB)
		Network calls with Retrofit/Ktor
	Dependency Injection
		Using Hilt or Dagger to reduce tight coupling
	Concurrency and Asynchrony
		Coroutines and Flow
		Thread safety and long-running operations
	Modularization
		Separate code into reusable, independently deployable modules (e.g., feature-login, core-network)
	Edge Cases
		Background tasks (WorkManager, AlarmManager)
		Sync failures and retries
		Handling low memory, storage, or connectivity
