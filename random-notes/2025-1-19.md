1. Int.rangeTo(valueTo) -> get a range
2. private fun Int.squared() = this * this
=> map(Int::squared)
3. Android Library with Jitpack
4. persistent bottom sheet vs modal bottom sheet:
    - persistent bottom sheet = remain on the screen alongside the main content
    => allow users to access supplementary information or controls without completely covering the screen
    - modal bottom sheet = temporarily overlay the main content and require explicit user interaction to be dismissed, such as tapping outside the sheet or swiping down
5. Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel
6. ModalBottomSheet vs BottomSheetScaffold
    - ModalBottomSheet = Blocks interaction with background; Temporary and contextual; Not part of a Scaffold; Tapping outside or swiping down	
    => Menus, confirmations, small forms
    - BottomSheetScaffold = Allows interaction with background; Persistent and integrated; Works as part of a Scaffold layout; Toggles between expanded/collapsed
    => Persistent content, secondary UI, persistent secondary content
    Exp: MusicPlayerController, persistent settings, task management
    - State:
    	Hidden
    	Expanded
    	PartiallyExpanded
7. StateEncapsulation (StateHositing + Abstraction)
    - encapsulate state logic into a class (state + functions)
    - state hoisting with rememberTopSheetState
    - state abstraction with remember
