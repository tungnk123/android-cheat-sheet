1. withContext waits for the block to complete. launch runs code in parallel and doesn't wait. 
=> Use withContext when the result or timing of the code matters.

2. Suspend function in depth:
	A function that can pause and resume without blocking threads.
	special kind of function in Kotlin that can pause (suspend) execution without blocking the thread, and resume later from 
		exactly the same point.
	Can only be called from another suspend function or coroutine
	They don't block threads
	Suspend doesn't mean "always suspend" -> they can run normally

3. coroutineScope suspend function:
	When to use:
		Inside a suspend function -> To safely launch new child coroutines
		When you want to wait for multiple jobs -> coroutineScope automatically waits for them
		When you want good error handling -> If one coroutine fails, all are canceled
		When you want no memory leaks or lost coroutines -> Keeps hierarchy clean

	=> You should always use coroutineScope if you're launching or async-ing anything!

	If you use async/launch inside suspend fun → wrap inside coroutineScope!
	Otherwise → you'll have very hard-to-debug crashes or leaks.

4. coroutineScope vs lifecycleScope vs viewModelScope
	coroutineScope:
		You create a temporary CoroutineScope manually inside a suspend function.
		Scope exists only for that block. (When block ends → scope disappears.)
		=> Handling parallel tasks inside a suspend function; Building structured concurrency manually.	lifecycleScope:
		Attached to a LifecycleOwner (Activity / Fragment).
		Automatically cancels coroutines when the LifecycleOwner is destroyed (e.g., Activity is finished).
		=> Doing short background jobs tied to Activity/Fragment (e.g., loading data); UI updates after async work.
	viewModelScope:
		Attached to ViewModel.
		Lives as long as the ViewModel is alive (even when screen rotates).
		Cancels automatically when ViewModel is cleared (e.g., Activity is destroyed).
		=> Managing UI State (LiveData, StateFlow) across screen rotations; Fetching data, caching data in ViewModel.

=> coroutineScope: Suspend function needing parallel work
=> lifecycleScope: Activity / Fragment needing a quick background job
=> viewModelScope: ViewModel needing to fetch/save data
