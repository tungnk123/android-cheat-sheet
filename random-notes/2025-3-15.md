Builder focuses on constructing complex objects step by step. 
Abstract Factory specializes in creating families of related objects

Builder usecase:
	Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescoping constructor”.
	Use the Builder pattern when you want your code to be able to create different representations of some product
	Use the Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects.

You can use Builder when creating complex Composite trees because you can program its construction steps to work recursively.

You can combine Builder with Bridge: the director class plays the role of the abstraction, while different builders act as 
	implementations.

Design Patterns in Android Application Development: Use Cases and Examples
	Singleton: used for managing shared resources, such as database instances, network clients, or application-wide settings
	Factory Method: the creation logic is complex or when objects need to be instantiated dynamically
	Observer: LiveData, StateFlow
	Builder:
