1. 10 Kotlin Coroutine Mistakes Seniors Should Avoid
	Blocking the Main Thread: using Thread.sleep() or runBlocking on the main thread -> delay()
	Using GlobalScope Everywhere -> Use structured concurrency (CoroutineScope)
	Not Handling Exceptions Properly -> CoroutineExceptionHandler, try/catch
	Ignoring CoroutineScope Lifecycle -> Tie coroutines to lifecycleScope (Android) or viewModelScope
	Using launch Instead of async for Result Handling -> Use async with await()
	Misusing Dispatchers -> Move heavy operations to Dispatchers.IO
	Forgetting to Cancel Coroutines -> cancel(), isActive, ensureActive()
	Using launch for Parallel Computation -> Use async for parallel execution
	Using Too Many Coroutines -> Use coroutine pools or Semaphore to limit concurrency
	Not Testing Coroutines Properly  -> Use TestCoroutineDispatcher

2. 8 Production-Grade Kotlin Code Styles I Learned from Real-World Experience
	Prefer Expression Functions for Single-Line Methods
	-> use expression body syntax instead of curly braces
	Use Enum Classes for Defining Constants Instead of Strings
	-> enum class Status { SUCCESS, ERROR, LOADING }
	Use Sealed Classes for Representing State
	Avoid Using !! (Double Bang) â€“ Handle Nulls Properly
	-> Use safe calls (?.), Elvis operator (?:), or requireNotNull to handle nullability properly
	Use Named Arguments for Better Readability in Function Calls
	Use buildString for Efficient String Concatenation
	Use sealed interface for Enums With Data
	Optimize Collection Operations with Sequence for Large Data
	-> When dealing with large lists, use Sequence instead of List to improve performance by enabling lazy evaluation.
