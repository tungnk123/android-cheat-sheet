1. **HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap vs HashTable**:
    - **HashMap** = a non-thread safe map implementation in Kotlin; faster in single-threaded scenarios because it doesn't have the overhead of synchronization
        - fail-fast: Iterators on HashMap throw a ConcurrentModificationException if the map is modified structurally during iteration
        - 1 null key, multiple null values
        =>  Use in single-threaded applications
    - **ConcurrentHashMap** = a thread-safe implementation of a HashTable
        - allow concurrent reads and writes without locking the entire map
        - Thread-safe, achieved using a fine-grained locking mechanism (bucket-level locking).
        - Multiple threads can read and write safely without blocking each other
        - Fail-Safe: Iterators are fail-safe, meaning modifications during iteration won't throw exceptions.
        Instead, the iterator reflects the state of the map at the time it was created (doesn't guarantee real-time consistency)
        - No null keys or null values allowed
        => Suitable for multi-threaded environments where multiple threads may need to read and modify the map concurrently
    - **HashTable** = A legacy, thread-safe map implementation from Java's early days
        - Does not allow null keys or null values
        - Fail-Fast: Iterators are fail-fast, like HashMap
        - Thread-safe, but uses synchronized methods, which block the entire map during access
        => Slower than ConcurrentHashMap in multi-threaded scenarios due to synchronization on every method
    
    => **HashTable: Thread-safe (synchronized); Slow (global lock)
    => ConcurrentHashMap: Thread-safe (fine-grained locks); Faster than Hashtable for concurrent access**
    
2. ConcurrentHashMap.compute(): add, update or delete value of a key in ConcurrentHashMap in a thread-safe manner
    - compute(key) {key, value ->
    // value is the current value of this key, null if not-existed -> return null to delete
    }
3. Use cache in Android with ConcurrentHashMap
    - **Main thread**: read data and show to UI
    - **IO thread**: fetch data
    - **Default thread**: use for sort, filter, search
4. ViewModel vs AndroidViewModel:
    - AndroidViewModel: need a Application Context
    => Access SharedPreferences, access Room db, ...
5. Intent vs PendingIntent vs IntentFilter
    - **Intent** = an object used to request an action from one component to another
    - **PendingIntent** = wrapper around an Intent that allows another app or system component to execute the Intent on your app's behalf in the future
    => actions need to be delayed or triggered later: Notifications, AlarmManager, ...
    Use: PendingIntent.getActivity(), PendingIntent.getService, PendingIntent.getBroadcast
    - **IntentFilter** = a way to declare in AndroidManifest.xml that an Activity, Service, BroadcastService can handle a spefic type of Intent
    => declares component that can handle Implicit Intents
6. Efficient IO With Buffered Reading & Writing In Kotlin
    - read and write byte by byte -> call a system call to OS -> slow
    - `FileInputStream.bufferedReader()`
