If you’re sure you’ll never use the callback → = Unit
 override fun onAccuracyChanged(sensor: Sensor?, accuracy: Int) = Unit
 If you might add logic later → {}

=> Explicitly returns Unit

You can’t put cornerFamily and cornerSize directly in the style used by ShapeableImageView.
 They belong to a ShapeAppearanceOverlay, not the view style itself.

<com.google.android.material.imageview.ShapeableImageView
    ...
    app:shapeAppearanceOverlay="@style/RoundedImageViewShape" />

=> Use app:shapeAppearanceOverlay for rounded corners — not a normal style tag.

A <provider> is a Content Provider declaration inside your Android AndroidManifest.xml.
A Content Provider is a system component that:
 Shares data between apps (safely and with permission control)
 Exposes a content URI (like content://com.example.app.provider/...
 Works as a secure bridge between apps and your private files/database

FileProvider is a ready-made subclass of ContentProvider provided by AndroidX.
✅ You use it to safely share files (images, PDFs, etc.) between apps
 ✅ It converts your private File path (/data/.../cache/my.jpg)
 into a safe content:// URI that you can share.


<provider
    android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.provider"
    android:exported="false"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true">

    <meta-data
        android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
        android:resource="@xml/file_paths" />
</provider>

android:authorities
A unique ID for your provider. Must match what you use in code. Usually ${applicationId}.provider.
android:grantUriPermissions="true"	
Allows you to grant temporary read/write access via intent flags.
<meta-data>	Points to an XML file defining which file paths your provider can share.


The file_paths.xml
This XML defines which directories your FileProvider is allowed to expose.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<paths>
    <!-- cache directory -->
    <cache-path name="shared_cache" path="." />

    <!-- external files directory -->
    <external-files-path name="shared_pictures" path="Pictures/" />

    <!-- (optional) DCIM -->
    <external-path name="dcim" path="DCIM/" />
</paths>

authority = The authority uniquely identifies your content provider to Android.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION → gives temporary access to the other app.

<provider> → declares a FileProvider in your manifest
authority → must match between manifest & code
file_paths.xml → defines safe shareable directories
FileProvider.getUriForFile() → converts File → content://
Always add FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION when sharing

val
 Runtime constant (value known at runtime)
 Can be assigned only once, but initialized dynamically
 Can be declared anywhere (inside classes, functions, etc.) 
 Works with any type
 ❌ Not usable in annotations

const val
 Compile-time constant (value known at compile time)
 Inlined directly into bytecode
 Must be declared at top-level, in an object, or companion object
 Type must be primitive or String
 ✅ Usable in annotations and default params
=> 
const val → fixed, compile-time constants
 val → read-only values decided at runtime
