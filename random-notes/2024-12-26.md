1. const val = compile-time constant
2. visibility modifier = public, protected, private, internal
3. Inline functions reduce the overhead of higher-order functions by copying the code of the function parameter
directly into the call site
=> replace function calls with the actual code of the function at compile time, reducing memory allocations and
improving runtime performance
=> small, frequently called functions that are critical to the performance of the code
4. Access Images in Android 10 -> Permission Denied
=> legacy storage vs scoped storage
=> android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"
5. Scoped Storage (Android 10+): Direct file-path access (_data) is restricted.
Relying on MediaStore.Images.Media.DATA or getRealPathFromUri often fails or returns null
6. Use Uri Directly: Instead of extracting the “real path,” open streams from Uri via ContentResolver
7. Copy to a Temp File (if you need a physical file path for libraries like FFmpegKit) -> cacheDir
8. No More requestLegacyExternalStorage Hacks: By embracing Uri operations and MediaStore, you avoid permissions issues on Android 10+ and maintain code consistency across newer versions
