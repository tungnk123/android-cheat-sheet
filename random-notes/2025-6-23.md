Kotlin: 5 Flow patterns every developers must know
	1. The Single Source of Truth: Flow from the Repository
		Your repository handles the messy business of fetching data from a database or network and simply exposes a clean, 
		observable Flow to your ViewModel.
		Your UI layer doesn't care how the data was fetched; it just cares about the data itself.

	2. Managing UI State Like a Pro with StateFlow
		the modern, coroutine-native version of LiveData
		The best practice is to use a "backing property."
	=> it's thread-safe, efficient (it won't emit the same value twice), and gives you a clear, centralized place to manage your 
		screen's entire state.

	3. The 'Toast Keeps Showing' Problem: SharedFlow for One-Off Events
		It's designed to broadcast values to multiple listeners

	4. When Two Streams Become One: The combine Operator
		It takes two (or more) flows and combines their latest values into a single new value whenever any of the original flows 
		emits something new.
	5. Don't Crash, Just catch
	-> Instead of wrapping your collect call in a messy try-catch block, you can use the declarative catch operator. It acts as a 
		safety net for your entire upstream flow.
