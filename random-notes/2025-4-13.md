1. Explain Clean Architecture. When does it become overkill?
	Entities (Enterprise Business Rules)
	Use Cases / Interactors (Application Business Rules)
	Interface Adapters (Delivery Mechanisms)
	Frameworks & Drivers (Outer Layer)
=>  Dependency Rule: Code dependencies only point inward—outer layers can depend on inner ones, but not the other way around.

2. Why Use Clean Architecture?
	Easy to test (use cases and entities are decoupled from UI and frameworks).
	Easy to maintain and scale as your app grows.
	Swappable components (e.g., switching from Room to Realm or Retrofit to Ktor).

3. When Does It Become Overkill?
	-> Clean Architecture has a cost—it's more boilerplate-heavy and complex upfront. It's overkill when:
	Your project is small or short-lived
		A simple app with just a few screens and minimal business logic may not benefit from this complexity.
	You’re the only developer
		If maintainability or team scaling isn’t a concern, simplicity might win.
	Your business logic is minimal
		If the app mostly just shows remote or local data without transformation, this architecture might be over-engineering.
	You need to ship quickly
		If you're prototyping or iterating fast, the structure might slow you down.

=> Just use when:
	Medium to large apps with growing complexity.
	Apps that need long-term maintainability.
	Teams with multiple developers.
	Apps that will evolve significantly over time (new platforms, features, or dependencies).
=> Alternative (Pragmatic) Approaches
	MVVM with Repository pattern (common in Android apps).
	Modularize gradually: start with separation of data, domain, and presentation layers.
	Feature-based architecture: organize by feature instead of strict layer-based packages.
