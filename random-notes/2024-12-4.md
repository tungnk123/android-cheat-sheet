1. Application class = base class within an Android app that contains all other components such as activities and services
2. A Service is a component that performs long-running operations in the background
Services do not provide a user interface; instead, they run in the background to handle tasks like data processing, file downloading, or playing music, even if the app isnâ€™t in the foreground
3. 3 type of service
    - foreground service: Runs actively and is visible to the user through a persistent notification in the notification bar; music players or navigation apps; higher priority
    - background service: Runs in the background without user interaction; Background tasks are generally handled by WorkManager or JobScheduler for greater efficiency
    - bound service: Allows components (like activities and fragments) to bind to the service, enablingcommunication; handle requests and return results to a client, such as fetching  data or updating an activity with real-time information
4. Service Lifycycle:
    - onCreate()
    - onStartCommand()
    - onBind()
    - onUnbind()
    - onDestroy()
