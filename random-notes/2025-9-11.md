Wake Lock:
	
	A wake lock is a mechanism in Android that lets an app keep the CPU (or screen) awake even when the device would normally
		 go to sleep.
	Normally, when the screen turns off, Android may let the CPU sleep to save battery → background work like music playback, 
		downloads, or navigation could stop.
	
	Types of wake locks

		Partial wake lock → keeps the CPU running, screen can turn off. (Most common for music playback.) 
		Screen wake locks → keep the screen bright or dim. (Used for reading apps, maps, etc.)
		Other combinations (CPU + screen together).
