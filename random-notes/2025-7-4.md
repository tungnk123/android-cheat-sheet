bit operator in Kotlin:
	left shift = shl = fill 0 on right = x 2^n

	right shift arithmetic = shr = shift right, preserve sigh bit (/ 2^n, floor)

	right shift logical = ushr = shift right, fill on left = pure bit shift 

I Refactored 100,000 Lines of Java Code — These 12 Rules Saved Me	
	Rule #1: Understand Before You Refactor
		Tip: Use tools like Ctrl + Alt + H in IntelliJ to find all usages before changing anything.
	Rule #2: Start with Unit Tests, Not Code

	Rule #3: Rename Like Your Life Depends On It
		“Good names reduce bugs.”
	Rule #4: Extract Methods Aggressively

	Rule #5: Follow the “Boy Scout Rule”
		“Leave the code cleaner than you found it.”
		Every time you touch a file, make one small improvement
		Rename a variable. Add a missing comment. Delete a TODO older than your project manager.

	Rule #6: Break Dependencies Mercilessly

	Rule #7: Write Logs That Speak Human

	Rule #8: Use the “WTF per Line” Metric
		“Code should not require a translator.”

		
	Rule #9: Don’t Just Delete — Replace with a Warning
		“Legacy code is haunted. Removing it releases the ghosts.”
	Rule #10: Re-review Your Own PRs After a Coffee Break
		I once added a new abstraction for something that was only used in one place. When I came back 30 minutes later, 
		I deleted it.
	Rule #11: Refactor One Responsibility at a Time
		“Multi-tasking in code = multi-bugs.”
		
	Rule #12: If It Ain’t Broke, Don’t Rewrite It
		“Refactoring ≠ rewriting.”
