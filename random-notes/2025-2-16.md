1. Kotlin Delegates
Kotlin delegates simplify and reuse code by allowing one object to handle certain tasks on behalf of another object.
It’s like saying, “Hey, you take care of this part for me!”

```
2 types of delegation in Kotlin:
	property delegation: Delegating property behavior to another object
	class delegation: Delegating the implementation of an interface to another object

```

1. Built-in Property Delegates in Kotlin:
Lazy delegation: the value is cached and reused whenever the property is accessed again
Exp: database, RetrofitBuilder, bitmap, ...
Observable Delegation: monitor changes to a property and react whenever its value changes
-> Live Data Tracking: Monitor and update UI settings in real time; Debugging: Track and log property changes

```
Vetoable Delegation: monitor and potentially block changes to a property’s value
-> Validation: Ensure a property’s value meets specific criteria before accepting changes.

Map Delegation: delegate property storage to a Map object

Delegating to Another Property: use the :: qualifier with the name of the delegate property
	var propertyName: Type by this::delegatePropertyName

```
