1. ProgressBar vs Slider
2. Service vs Intent Service
	Service:	
		can be used in tasks with no UI, but shouldn't be too long
		run in main UI thread
		Handle multiple requests concurrently
		Run indefinitely until stopped manually by stopSelf() or stopService()
	=> Best for persistent background tasks
	IntentService: 
		IntentService is a subclass of Service, written in Java.
		can be used in long tasks usually with no communication to Main Thread
		run on a background thread
		the automatic queuing of Intents delivered to onStartCommand()
		the automatic shutdown of the IntentService
		process requests one at a time in a queue
		stop itself after completing the task
	=> When you want to perform multiple background tasks one by one which exists beyond the scope of an Activity then 
	the IntentService is perfect
	=> Best for short, independent background tasks like network requests, file downloads
=> IntentService is deprecated since Android API 30 -> Use WorkManager or Foreground service

3. IntentService vs WorkManager
	IntentService: 
		Runs in a single background thread (serial execution)
		One-time task execution
		No battery-optimized execution 
		Stops when app is killed
	WorkManager: 
		Uses internally managed worker threads (can be parallel)
		One-time or periodic execution
		Battery efficiencfy: optimized by using JobScheduler (respects Doze mode)
		Persists even after app is killed or device restarts
		Can handle parallel or chained tasks
		Run on constraint e.g Wifi, Charging, ...
=> WorkManager: scheduled, deferrable and guaranteed exection tasks likes syncing data
