1. Dependency Injection in Android
	There are three ways for a class to get an object it needs:
		The class constructs the dependency it needs
		Grab it from somewhere else. Some Android APIs, such as Context getters and getSystemService(), work this way.
		Have it supplied as a parameter. The app can provide these dependencies when the class is constructed or 
			pass them into the functions that need each dependency.
	There are three major ways to do dependency injection in Android:
		Constructor Injection. 
		Field Injection (or Setter Injection) (for Activity, Fragment)
		Method Injection, you can use @Inject annotation with method also.
