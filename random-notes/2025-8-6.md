Refactor ViewModel: small, delegate 

onComplete vs onComplete() vs onComplete.invoke()
	onComplete = a reference to the function / lmabda = address of the function, not call

	onComplete() = call the function immediately
	onComplete.invoke() = call the function explicitly = onComplete()
		

Collect Flows only when needed — avoid nested collect and don’t block inside them.
Nested collect calls, Unnecessary re-collection -> bug -> Only collects each flow once via .first()
Avoid nested collect.
 Instead, use:
 	combine(flowA, flowB) { a, b -> ... }
 	flatMapLatest
 	collectLatest for cancellation
 	first() if you just need the latest value once, You don’t need to react to changes afterward
=> One-time load on screen start: use first()
=> Real-time updates: use flatMapLattest()

ViewHolder
	itemView.context.getString
