Combining Flows: Weaving Multiple Data Streams
	zip: Combines elements from two flows pair-wise. It waits for both flows to emit a value before applying the transformation 
		function and emitting a new value

	combine: Emits a new value whenever any of the source flows emit, using the latest value from each of the combined flows

	merge: This simply combines multiple flows into a single flow, preserving the relative timing of emissions

Advanced Error Handling: Building Resilient Flows
	catch: This operator allows you to intercept exceptions that occur upstream (before the catch operator in the flow chain)
	onEach { ... } with catch { ... }: For side effects like logging before error handling, use onEach followed by catch.
	retry() and retryWhen(): These powerful operators enable you to automatically retry a flow's execution upon failure.
	retry(retries: Long): Retries a fixed number of times.
	retryWhen(predicate: suspend (cause: Throwable, attempt: Long) -> Boolean): Provides fine-grained control over retry logic, 
		allowing you to implement strategies like exponential backoff or retrying only for specific error types.

PCM vs WAV: write raw audio samples (ShortArray) to a .pcm file, then prepend a RIFF/WAV header to make a playable .wav.

Buffered I/O & ByteBuffer reuse: use a single BufferedOutputStream and reuse a ByteBuffer to minimize allocations and system calls.

Snapshot flow: flush the PCM stream, create a MediaStore URI, write the WAV header, copy raw PCM via copyTo(), then clear the pending flag.

Foreground service: launch with startForegroundService(), set stopWithTask="true", and unbind on UI clear so the service stops when 
	swiped away.

Pause/Resume: use a boolean flag to halt both file writes and analysis flows without closing the stream.

Room converters: add @TypeConverters (e.g. JSON for List<LevelSample>, String ↔ Uri, String ↔ LocalDateTime) so Room can persist complex types.
