1. git clone --recurse-submodules
2. view binding vs data binding
    - viewbinding:
    straightforward, lightweight tool that generates binding classes for each XML layout file
    It allows you to access views directly in code without needing findViewById
    Itâ€™s simple to use, as it automatically generates a binding class for each XML file,
    where each view can be referenced directly through its ID
    - Data Binding:
    allows you to bind data directly to the XML layout, enabling a reactive, two-way binding
    setup where the UI automatically updates in response to changes in data
3. PagingSource vs PagingData vs PagingAdapter
    - PagingSource: Defines how to load data pages from a data source (e.g., database or network).
    - PagingData: A container holding paginated data that the UI can observe and render.
    - PagingAdapter: A RecyclerView adapter designed to submit PagingData to the UI and handle diffing and display of data items.
