1. TDD = test driven development = an approach
    - write tests before writing the actual code
    - ensure the code meets the defined requirements
2. **debugging vs testing**
    - debugging = process of finding and fixing errors
    - testing = process of verifying the the code works as expected
3. **memory leak**
    - holding references to objects that are no longer needed
    - retained references =  a situation where an object continues to hold a reference to another
    object that should have been released, leading to potential memory leaks.
    E.g. long lifecycle object (singleton, static field, retained fragments) hold a reference to
    shorter lifecyle object (activity, context)
    - circular references, retained references
    - improper use of static variables
4. Android Prolifer => provide realtime data on
    - CPU usage
    - memory allocation
    - network activity
    - battery usage
5. Testing in android = unit testing, integration testing, UI testing, end-to-end testing
6. **Networking in android**
retrofit = a type-safe HTTP client, REST APIs
Gson = java library to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa
Caching in network request = stores responses locally to reduce network request, performance
E.g. OkHttp, Retrofit support caching machanism
WebSockets = full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection	
=> realtime-communication between the client and server
Network security: use HTTPs, validate SSL certificates, avoid storing sensitive data in plain text
gRPC = high-performance, RPC framework => efficient communications
Optimize network performance: mininize number of requests, caching, compressing data
7. collectAsState() vs observeAsState()
8. Single Source of Truth in android architecture
=> avoid data inconsistencies
9. WorkManager workers types: Worker, CoroutineWorker, RxWorker, ListenableWorker
10. Principles for good architecture
    - separation of concern
    - no hard dependency -> dependency injection
    - manage lifecycle and data persistence -> architecture components
